Thanks!

I think the discoverability problem is mostly one of [preferential attachment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferential_attachment) or assortative mixing.

I haven't heard of another software named Library so I think it is unique. The generic part might be the confusion with the term "software libraries" or a local physical library. Search engines can easily distinguish between all these different types of "library".
