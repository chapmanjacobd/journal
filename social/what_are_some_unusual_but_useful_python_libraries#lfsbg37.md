I compared a bunch of different MCDA packages and `pymcdm` is really fantastic: https://gitlab.com/shekhand/mcda

I also like https://github.com/hydrargyrum/timecalc as a CLI tool to doing math with time. As a library this is basically just `dateutil` which is another fantastic 3rd party library. I used dateutil to make a [very simple CLI tool](https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/library/blob/main/xklb/text/dates.py) to turn natural language into something GNU `date` can understand (though `date` understands quite a bit on its own)
