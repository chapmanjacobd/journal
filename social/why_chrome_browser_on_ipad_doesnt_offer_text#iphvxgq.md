It's likely the problem of the website. Everything within the app frame is the responsibility of the app developer so because the option is even there means that text/scale zooming should be possible.

Because reddit includes this in their website HTML code: 
 
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />

Solution:

There might be a "Enable force zoom" option in Chrome accessibility settings.
