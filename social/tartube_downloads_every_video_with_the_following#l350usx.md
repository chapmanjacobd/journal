It's because YouTube wants you to watch a special video. It's not really possible to fix this unless you own YouTube or have many IP addresses that you can switch between--but even then you'll probably get this warning every so often

If you get that for _all_ player responses then it is an error and you won't be able to download the video without changing IPs
