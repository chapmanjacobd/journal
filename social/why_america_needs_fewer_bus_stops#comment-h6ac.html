<p>I don't disagree. I live in a small town in the midwest that has decent public transit infra thanks to the university. I even live a short walk from the bus terminal where the buses sleep but I have never once ridden the bus because the scheduling and routing doesn't really make sense? It's like the planners all have car brain and they don't think like pedestrians.</p>
<p>There's zero effective "interconnect" with Amtrak (despite having a large bus turnaround and parking lot across the street from the Amtrak station) because the bus hours and route scheduling don't make any effort to do so. It is almost bizarre compared to the experience with public transport in 3rd world countries where transport <em>has to work</em> or nothing gets done.</p>
