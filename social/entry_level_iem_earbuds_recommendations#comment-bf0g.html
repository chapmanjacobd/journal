<p>I've tried a bunch over the years and I really like these: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072ZBV9H9/">Tennmak Pro</a>. Sure, they are cheap as hell but they definitely sound above average, and they are very comfortable. For me they have a flat frequency response (this will depend on your ear canal shape because IEMs are very different from studio monitors).</p>
