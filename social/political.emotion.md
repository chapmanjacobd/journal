Logic is not the driving force of political ideology. If it was then it would be a science: largely undisputed. The more that an ideology is tied to their identity, the more emotional reasons people need to unfix themselves. If you only provide logical technicalities their brain will only fight harder to shore up their worldview.

### Conservatism

Driving Emotions: Loyalty, Apathy, Forgiveness?

### Republicanism

Driving Emotions: Pride, Fear of loss of power via Conservative apathy

Republicanism exists because Conservativism "needs" to go further than doing nothing to "maintain" the status quo in an dynamic political system where other moods (Liberalism, Libertarianism, Leftism, and Populism) pull the status quo away from stasis. Thus Republicanism naturally leads into Populism where the government can be butchered until the status quo is reconstructed under Liberalism and Leftism.

### Liberalism

### Libertarianism

Driving Emotions: Trauma, Distrust

### Leftism

### Populism
