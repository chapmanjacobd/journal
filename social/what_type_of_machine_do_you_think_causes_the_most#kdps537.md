Was going to comment something like this. It's not like people are building settlements near Thunderjaw machine sites. So deaths are a function of the probability that people encounter machines. The machines that are closest to settlements likely cause the most deaths.

But there is one more factor:

After [Hephaestus](https://hzd.fandom.com/wiki/HEPHAESTUS#Hostility_to_Humans) became a full A.I. it started to include humans in its machine maintenance analysis and it decided to make machines hostile toward humans and eventually more aggressive so they wouldn't need to be replaced as often. These newer machines more actively "hunt" humans and so the more recent machines are more likely to kill because they actively search for humans (Land-gods --> Plowhorns. They are both the same machine but one is newer).
