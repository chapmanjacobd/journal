> Netflix ‘watch random episode’ button. Occasionally I just want to watch a random episode of a TV show and don’t like being made to pick. /  Netflix shuffle episode option

I made something similar. It doesn't work with netflix but you can add any location on your hard drive or in YouTube and play videos or music randomly or in order.
