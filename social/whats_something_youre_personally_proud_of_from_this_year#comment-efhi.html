<p>I started my first eBay affiliate website! I'm proud of what I built but at the same time I feel a mixture of hope and doubt. I don't like talking about the same things over and over--which is kind of required to be successful in creating <a href="https://unli.xyz/diskprices/us/">backlinks</a>. I like incrementally improving things instead of that.</p>
<p>I'm hopeful for the future but also equally terrified and depressed.</p>
