I don't use PARA--but for my organization method I use it almost universally. For my phone, laptop, desktop, server, backup server. Many of these folders are synced with syncthing but not all of them. Notes are in one subfolder.

I used to use obsidian but I don't find much value in crosslinking or transclusion. I use codium instead of obsidian to edit my notes and I use ripgrep a lot.
