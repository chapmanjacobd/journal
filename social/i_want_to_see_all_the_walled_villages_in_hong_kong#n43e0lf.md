From looking at Wikipedia it seems like there are a few that are somewhat easily accessible but most of them are in more rural areas. 

I would be surprised if _all_ of them are open to the public but it does look like at least a few of them accept visitors and even have a museum component. If you had a car I think it would take at least a week to visit all of them. If you just want to drive past them and take a quick pic from outside--maybe you could do it in a couple days
