<p>I'm listening to the BADBADNOTGOOD new-<em>ish</em> album, <em>Mid Spiral</em> released in October 2024. It's jazz / electronic. They usually have a few vocal tracks sung by other artists.</p>
<p>If you haven't heard of BBNG be sure to listen to <a href="https://badbadnotgoodofficial.bandcamp.com/track/hyssop-of-love-feat-mick-jenkins">Hyssop of Love (Feat. Mick Jenkins)</a></p>
