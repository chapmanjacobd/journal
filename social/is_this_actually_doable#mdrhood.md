I would still try to save 20-30%. Your plan seems a little optimistic but mostly on the right track! 

I've saved between 70-80% in the past and it's been over a year since I've been employed. You can't always assume that everything will go smoothly. If you save more, you can retire faster which seems like the whole point of financial independence!

Enjoy your best years but also spend wisely
