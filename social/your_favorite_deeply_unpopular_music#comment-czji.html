<p>It's probably not super unpopular but I just wanted to share this apocalyptic neofolk song that I just found:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"As a lone ant from a broken ant-hill<br/>
From the wreckage of Europe, ego scriptor"<br/>
<a href="https://sol-invictus.bandcamp.com/track/from-the-wreckage">From The Wreckage | Sol Invictus</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's not perfect but it was interesting enough that I listened to the rest of the album. It reminds me a bit of my brother's music</p>
