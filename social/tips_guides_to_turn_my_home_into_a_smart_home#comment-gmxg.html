<p>I would start small. Some of the things like monitoring your home electricity usage will be expensive and it might be redundant if your energy provider already provides graphs of your usage on their website. I've found that even small "dumb" devices like motion/light sensitive nightlights can be a big quality of life boost. Anything that is a simple state machine will be a lot more reliable and less frustrating than something that connects to a network.</p>
<p>Even smart lights can be unresponsive and annoying. It's not a matter of name brand either--if anything I've had more luck with random Chinese companies than GE.</p>

<p>I haven't noticed this so I wouldn't be too worried. But most devices will want to connect at 2.4Ghz and it helps to have everything on the same network. If you're worried about home network security you could double NAT your other devices or set up a VLAN or something</p>

<p>#4. A few quick disconnected statements: Home Assistant is overkill and can be a big time sink; choose an ecosystem like Google Home or Apple HomeKit to build around if you want things to be easy to setup. I haven't had good luck with Zwave or Zigbee. Reolink is pretty good for security cameras.</p>
