<p>Many well-intentioned centrists rely on information and feelings which are most readily available to them. Moderation and compromise in terms of maintaining a status quo relies on unshifting alternatives. As one party moves more to the right they bring the median option closer to the right. It's difficult to evaluate things fairly by comparing them to the visible alternatives when the visible alternatives are not honest takes and thus not a balanced representation of thought. This is essentially the <a href="https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/secrets-of-the-median-voter-theorem">median mechanism</a>--including when choosing representative candidates when the diversity of thought is biased and leans a certain way.</p>
<p>If you are taking the time to listen to and adopt solutions from extremists, is that still centrism? When does centrism become something that looks more like rationalism than centrism? Is centrism logical consistency, evidence-based reasoning, and a systematic analysis of problems and solutions, regardless of whether those solutions fall on the left or right of the political spectrum? Well... that's the philosophical position of rationalism. I guess centrism focuses more on social stability at the expense of logical consistency, yes? The pursuit of middle-ground at the expense of evidence and reason.</p>
