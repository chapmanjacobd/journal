Digital currency idea which solves income disparity to an nth degree:

moneyA + moneyB is required by a certain proportion in every transfer/transaction. moneyA is permanent. moneyB is "destroyed" in every transaction.

People only have access to one personal account their entire life and it generates a certain amount of moneyB every x amount of time.

(People/organizations could have "business" accounts which store moneyA and moneyB but they don't spontaneously generate moneyB.)

The proportion of moneyA to moneyB required for each transaction might need to be adjusted as more people are born or it might not?
