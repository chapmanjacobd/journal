<p>A couple weeks ago I bought a hard drive lot that was listed as "3x" from the seller "shipcycle" but it took them like two weeks to only ship one (in a box only large enough to ship one). Their listing was still up with multiple quantity available. I gave them a few days to respond. But they didn't. So I returned it and added them to a bad sellers list in my Disk Prices on eBay site to be auto-filtered out.</p>
<p>Other than that I've had pretty good experiences with eBay. I've only had one hard drive (8TB) that arrived bad and the seller sent the money back ($60) without me even needing to return it.</p>
<p>But other than stuff like hdds, vintage camera lenses or specific clothes (I went through a phase where I would only wear wool like Pendleton shirts, etc) I don't use eBay that much. There often isn't that much of a premium on buying used things aka <em>it's expensive to be poor</em>.</p>
<p>I'd like to see more people use those "Buy Nothing" groups where people <a href="https://youtu.be/djO-JNl7skM">give away what they don't want and take what they need</a>.</p>
