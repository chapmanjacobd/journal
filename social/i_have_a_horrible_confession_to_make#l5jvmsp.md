You could say the same thing about AV1. It has no right to look as good as it does at 500 kb/s. It's INSANE. But again, you'll get more quality "bang for your buck" with x264.

Opus and AV1 create _TONS_ of artifacts but they are audibly/visually pleasant enough that they are difficult to notice unless you are EQ-ing to hell and back or using a LUT or xcalib, etc
