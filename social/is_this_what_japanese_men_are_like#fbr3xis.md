Hmm... Difficult to say. Yes Japanese people on average are more reserved but I think the more important thing to ask is why should it matter? You will not give up dating him if all Japanese men are like him? Or you will give up dating any Japanese men because you think all Japanese people are like him?

Ultimately you should communicate with him what you expect in a relationship or adjust yourself to feel more comfortable with the status quo
