If anything, special building projects (which can't be safely re-purposed in a cost-effective way) should have the cost of demolition baked into the project and that money goes to the municipality in a special trust where the owner or the city can use it to demo the building rather than the community bearing the cost of its disuse, years of abandonment, and eventually annexation and demolition.
