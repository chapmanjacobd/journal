<p>Maybe try cooling down your body instead of the room?</p>
<ul>
<li>plastic bucket/box with cold water and putting your feet in there</li>
<li>cool, damp clothe on the nape of the neck, underarms, or thighs. using ice or anything really cold will cause vasoconstriction, which reduces blood flow in the area, undermining what youâ€™re trying to do.</li>
<li>cold shower</li>
</ul>
<p>Easy electrolyte formula</p>
<ul>
<li>1 liter of water</li>
<li>1/8 tsp epsom salt (as often as needed)</li>
<li>1/8 tsp non-iodized salt (as often as needed)</li>
<li>1/4 tsp potassium chloride/salt substitute/no-salt (daily maximum)</li>
