<p>We finally got our mini-split air conditioner installed and it is working great! The most stressful part was drilling through the brick wall. On my first try I was 1cm away from drilling the pilot bit into live wire. Scary! We moved the hole a couple inches down and there was only insulation. Drilling the actual brick was also a bit difficult because the brick was hollow (our house is over 100 years old--<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Construction/comments/1ih99xo/do_they_no_longer_use_these_hollow_clay_bricks_in/">from what I read this isn't commonly used anymore</a>) but the hollow void made it difficult to keep the slight downward slope. If I had to do it again, pre-drilling a pilot hole all the way through would have definitely helped--but I didn't order a separate bit long enough for that.</p>
<p>Yesterday I over-tightened the 1/4 inch low pressure line and broke the flare off (I guess some nylog got on the threads because the torque wrench wasn't activating) so I had to re-flare the copper pipe. Luckily, AutoZone had a flaring set to loan for free (for brake lines) but had to buy an pipe cutter... the only place nearby that had one was WalMart. So dealing with that was a bit stressful--but in the end everything worked out fine. Pulled down a vacuum down to 280 microns--it slowly went up to 380 after 15 minutes of isolation so maybe there is a small leak but I pressurized it and there weren't any air bubbles with the gas leak detector...</p>
