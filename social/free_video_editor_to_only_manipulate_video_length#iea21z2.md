If you can use the CLI, ffmpeg is really fast and easy to automate.

Also, there are many Lua scripts for mpv which use ffmpeg and allow you to set as many in/out points as you want and export one concatenated video or individual clips. It might take some time to get set up but if you have many things to edit you'll be able to work without moving the mouse and it will be easier to get into the flow.
