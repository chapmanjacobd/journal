<p>If high performance is not 100% necessary maybe you could focus on the portable aspect. The laptop that I have now is a little over 1kg and the 99wh battery lasts about 20 hours in low power mode. It's a Tuxedo Pulse 15 Gen1.</p>
<p>I don't exactly recommend you buy it because it is already a few years old (although they are releasing an updated Pulse 15 Gen3 probably in 3~6 months) but mostly because the Tuxedo company is focused mostly on Linux support (and the keyboard is unfortunately very cheap feeling)--but I absolutely do highly recommend trying to find a laptop with a &gt;70 watt-hour battery and include weight in your comparison. It really makes a difference in portability.</p>
<p>I've also never had many complaints with business-line HP (EliteBook) or Dell (Latitude/Precision) laptops. I would never buy <strong>consumer</strong> laptops from either company but it might be a good option to find something lightweight from those product lines.</p>
<p>Also, if you use the laptop at home I would highly recommend setting up an ergonomic workspace because laptops have extremely terrible ergonomics. This could be as simple as an ergonomic laptop stand (or a laptop dock using an external monitor and keyboard), or as complex as an adjustable bed frame, a Quantum 8" Edge Elite Pocketed Coil + dunlop latex mattress, a Logitech K400 Plus, and a MagicHold 3 in 1 360 Degree Rotating Height Adjustable Laptop Tablet Stand. Ergonomics FTW!!</p>
