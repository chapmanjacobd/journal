for sure 

many people within the CIA don't believe it exists either and they deny any medical claims by supposed victims

I think everyone has different amounts of asymmetrical information or it's most likely an imagined condition spread by paranoia and rumor. but still it is possible that it exists and people deny it because there is no evidence

as far as I'm aware both Russia and Cuba have denied that it exists
