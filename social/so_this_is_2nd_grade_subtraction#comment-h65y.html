<p>Sure! That's a valid strategy as long as you have enough subtractions memorized, ie. knowing that it will be useful to take 14 instead of 10.</p>
<p>If you don't know ahead of time and don't know where to start, a sub-strategy could be to recursively splitting in half like a binary search, ie. 44 = 22 + 11 + 6 + 3 + 2</p>
<p>Then you could pick the number that's closest to 7 and any left over you could subtract again from the next closest number until you have only additions left</p>
<p>22 + 11 + (6 - 6) + 3 + (2 -1)</p>
<p>(22-20) + 11 + 3 + 1</p>
<p>2 + 11 + 3 + 1</p>
<p>17</p>
