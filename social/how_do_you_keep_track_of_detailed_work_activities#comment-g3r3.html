<p>It sounds like you might be able to write a userscript to pull out some information from the webapp but it sounds like your problem is <em>beyond technology</em>. Maybe you could institute <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_management_(ITSM)">change controls</a> if you can convince management</p>

<p>If it's useful to copy the metadata database into git, you can use SQLite to visualize changes. It's not perfect but works in a pinch and probably better than you might think:</p>
<pre><code>$ tee -a .gitattributes
*.db       diff=sqlite3

$ tee -a .git/config
[diff "sqlite3"]
    binary = true
    textconv = "echo .dump | sqlite3"
</code></pre>
<p>Though... if you have a way of dumping the metadata to sqlite, surely dumping it to CSV, or something more human-readable would also be possible and that will likely be better. You don't need to write any append or sync code--git handles that all that state for you--just obliterate the existing fstree each time</p>
