<p>But yeah, a lot of these border on ego-mania and are not that useful in real situations.</p>
<p>What I like about this is the endeavor of collecting a generalized list. Collecting something new (things not commonly collected and generalized) is itself creative and is thought-provoking.</p>
<p>It's kind of wild that someone would spend the time to make a <code>/death</code> web page but they wouldn't make a legal will instead. I can understand that it might not be common or affordable in Russia though. I don't think <code>/death</code> will become a generalized pattern any time soon but it is interesting to think why that is the case and what is blocking that from happening.</p>
<p>It would be more useful if the site did some scraping to figure out what is commonly used and re-order the existing entries by their popularity. I would imagine that <code>/contact</code> and <code>/about</code> would be #1 and #2</p>
