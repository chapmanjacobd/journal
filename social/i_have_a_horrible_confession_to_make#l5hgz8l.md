Of course! I'm not throwing shade at AV1 or Opus... they are state-of-the-art codecs for compression.

That being said I don't think AV1, Opus, and AVIF are good "archival"-quality formats as long as other more "quality balanced" codecs exist--if you care about quality, spend the GBs and use x264, FLAC, and TIFF; but AV1, Opus, and AVIF are valid alternatives to deleting
