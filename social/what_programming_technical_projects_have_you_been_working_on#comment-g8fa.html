<p>How do y'all handle all this weight on your desks?!</p>

<p>I wouldn't put the PC on the desk... that seems like a waste of valuable space. (Especially since moving to a standing desk that is even a bit more sensitive to weight. I keep my PC on the ground but I have to put my UPS on top of my PC case so that the wires to the display are long enough...)</p>
