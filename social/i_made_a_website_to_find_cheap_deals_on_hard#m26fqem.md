I think it makes sense to pre-filter any disk sizes larger than 32. I'll add that

Yeah it's difficult to filter out the empty NAS situation because sometimes people will say "32TB NAS" and it'll be empty but other times it'll be full of drives... Technically, the sellers are listing the empty NAS in the wrong eBay category... But I'll keep looking for patterns to see if I can remove more of the empty listings without making false negatives.
