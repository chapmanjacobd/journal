<p>Ah!</p>
<p>It's because I print a status line after the printf--(ie. cat /proc/loadavg) so that's why I need to subtract 1</p>
<p>but other people either don't need that or they'll want to subtract more if they print more than one informational lines</p>
<p>I will edit the OP to include this information</p>
