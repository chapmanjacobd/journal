honestly this is just a marketing gimmick at this point. Something like zstd can compress more than hardware compression.

The total cost of ownership for a large array is similar until you get into the PB range. Hard drives are easier to work with until they break.

Tape works the best when you read and write linearly. LTFS is kind of a hack and it adds a lot of wear to both the tape and the drive. Hard drives are much better at random access compared to tape.

I think this a bit of marketing too. Hard drive vendors want us to buy products continuously and they only want to offer a warranty for five years because that's the shortest amount of time that sounds impressive. Tape vendors are _selling_ long-term storage. But no one has tested that LTO9 can actually last 30 years. It probably will... but tape vendors also want you to buy tape _drives_.

The _mechanical_ failure rate (MTBF) is similar for hard drives and tape drives. Things that move wear out. With tape you are centralizing that wear to some extent.

That being said, for a large amount of data, tape can be very cost-effective! And the importance of humidity/solar/temp stable storage for both hard drives and tape cannot be understated!
