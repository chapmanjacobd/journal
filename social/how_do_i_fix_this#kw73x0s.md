This isn't really an ffmpeg issue at all. You can try contacting the developer of that app. You might try going into the Android settings, navigate to that app and then try enabling Full Filesystem access (if it is an option)--otherwise it seems likely that that app was made for a lower version of Android which had more lax security permissioning. 

With each version of Android especially Android 9, 11, and 13, the permissioning API has gotten more specific and requires app developers to make large changes to the apps to release as updates
