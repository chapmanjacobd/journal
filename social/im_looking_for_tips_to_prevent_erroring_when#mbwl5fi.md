I recommend downloading metadata first and then fan out downloads using multiple IPs using something like squid-dl.

If you only have one IP address then you could use something like [this](https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/library/). It doesn't prevent blocking but it has a fairly robust retry mechanism so you can retry downloading previously failed videos without downloading all the channel metadata over and over
