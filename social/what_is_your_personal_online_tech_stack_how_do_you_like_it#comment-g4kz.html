<p>That makes sense. I guess for me I see the registrar aspect as largely an administrative service: bureaucratic paperwork. As long as they have a good relationship with ICANN it doesn't matter much especially when you are already using a different service to manage the DNS records.</p>
<p>If I was more concerned about privacy I might opt for something like <a href="https://njal.la/faq/">Njalla</a>. Compared to something like that, where there is more legal separation, I don't see many differences between registrar offerings. But I guess from a security perspective it would help in the situation that someone had access to your Cloudflare account but not Porkbun. I can see that</p>
