<p>I made a website to search Hard Drive prices ($/TB) on eBay: <a href="https://unli.xyz/diskprices/">https://unli.xyz/diskprices/</a></p>
<p>There are still a few bugs but so far it's coming along very nicely. Not bad for a few days of head-scratching! A little bit more regex has been burned into my muscle memory. I still have a pretty long TODO list but any initial feedback would be helpful.</p>
<p>You can add custom filters at the bottom of the page. I think having a button at the top or maybe enabling some defaults will help make that feature more discoverable. I've really enjoyed using the DataTables.net library. It has been a godsend!! But it does block the event loop for a couple seconds when loading the page the first time...</p>
