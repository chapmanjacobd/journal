Fair enough--but I don't exactly want it to scream youtube hoarding either... I'd rather keep things low-key.

If people just want to do youtube hoarding you don't really need my wrapper to do it. yt-dlp works just fine; and depending on what you are looking for TubeArchivist will be a better fit.

I want my software to be easy to use but with avant garde functionality. The name Library lends itself well to that end. There are many things you can do in a library but you have to discover each thing one at a time
