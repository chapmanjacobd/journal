> Am I crazy for thinking about staying as a tech for 2 decades

If you like where you are now there is no problem with living and enjoying life. Take it a year at a time. You'll know when it's time to go. I would stay until you feel like you are languishing.

Maybe try and see if it is possible to do a Masters part time (like nights or weekends). A Masters is helpful if you _want_ to do research or if you want to pivot to a different career. 

If you know how to create and sell value then getting further education might not be the best deal--even if it is free (you will still have obligations to the university and you will be "working" on someone else's clock). People that tell you otherwise have a vested interest in perpetuating the value of formal education. But if you struggle to self-motivate and you need someone to set goalposts it is a valid external motivator.
