<p>I am an optimist. I think people that do this are well-intentioned. People feel lonely and want to socialize. They want to make friends. But not everyone is an expert on every topic and so they ask an "AI" to help them communicate with another human. It's better that they preface something with "I asked ChatGPT..." but I think eventually people will stop prefacing just like they have stopped prefacing "I asked Google..." even though they are totally different tools people are using them in a similar way with about the same amount of media literacy as before</p>
