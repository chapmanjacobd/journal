Yeah, honestly this is the way to go. Tape libraries can scale well in the right environment but they also have externalities:

1. It takes a lot of time to learn and troubleshoot [tapes](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ts4500-tape-library?topic=cartridge-reattaching-leader-pin-in-lto-tape) and tape drives--especially if you are dealing with older technology that continues to age. Maybe LTO5 drives are plentiful and cheap today but it's possible that in just a few years they will become more expensive than VCRs are now.

2. SAS drives require custom hardware but SAS interfaces are still a lot more plentiful than tape drives and buying a [SAS array](https://www.ebay.com/itm/176547574313) should be cheaper than buying a single tape drive. 
3. Modern drives are likely just as resilient as tapes when stored in similar conditions. The key difference is that the mechanical parts are likely to fail first and LTO keeps the mechanical parts and the data separate. When you use the same tape drive it centralizes the wear--this isn't necessarily good or bad--an infrequently used automobile can break due to different stress conditions than a frequently used one--but when things do break you need to know how to fix the tape drive (or buy a new one) vs move drive platters to recover data. To reiterate this point: if you have multiple tape drives you don't need downtime to read a specific tape when a tape drive breaks; if you have multiple SAS drives you can't access the data on the drive when it breaks without doing some clean-room recovery.
