<p>Yesterday, I watched <em>Doctor Zhivago</em> (1965) due to its <a href="https://tildes.net/~movies/1owv/classic_movies#comment-fxvq">recommendation</a> in the classic movies thread a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>It's three hours long but never boring. The introduction part with old Yevgraf is kind of unnecessary--but it's not that long and it adds context for the film and ties it together somewhat at the end.</p>
<p>It's weird to watch a film set in a foreign place and everyone speaks English. The story takes place in Russia but most of it was actually filmed in Spain. It's thematically and emotionally similar to <em>Les Miserables</em> but it is also very different.</p>
