<p>It's interesting to see that even the CSS Naked Day website is still using CSS on <em>Naked Day</em> which is today.</p>
<p>Some of the participating websites mentioned here: <a href="https://css-naked-day.org/2025.html">css-naked-day.org/2025.html</a> claim to be CSS-free but... it still seems like they are using a lot of CSS.</p>
<p><em>perhaps people are ashamed of being naked just like in real life</em></p>
<p>Taking a look at many of the other CSS Naked Day participants... Their websites really don't work well without CSS--things which should be at the top are in the middle of the page, etc. Hopefully this helps people think more about their HTML structure but I kinda doubt it.</p>
<p>I've said this before a couple times, but browsers really need to have a less awful default styling. There are millions of Word and Excel documents which get away with default "unstyled" styling but <em>unstyled</em> web pages look abhorrent in comparison. Not all sites use JavaScript but <em>every</em> site uses at least some CSS. I know this is not likely to ever change... but I feel like it is one of the very large reasons why the web largely does not follow the standards that closely. If web documents looked good in no-css mode we might have a lot more "collection of documents" than the "collection of walled gardens" that we have today</p>

<p><small>NSFW but I found this video when searching "CSS naturism" and I find it notable... but it is somewhat the opposite of what I was looking for: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:CSS_Naturist.webm">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:CSS_Naturist.webm</a></small></p>
