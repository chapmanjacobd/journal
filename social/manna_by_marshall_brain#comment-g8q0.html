<p>I found <em>Manna</em> through <a href="https://www.halfbakery.com/idea/Voice_20declares_20free_20agency#1755402472">the halfbakery</a>. It was shared on Tildes a while ago but it is an interesting read and I think it deserves more eyes.</p>
<p>My wife recently started working part-time at Walmart and it is eerily similar to this story. After clocking in the Walmart phone will tell her where to go and what needs to be done. Check these shelves, replace these barcodes, verify the count of the in-stock of specific products... maybe not quite as integrated but it wouldn't take much to have it fully integrated and remove the local managers. It seems like a lot of the managers at the local Walmart are always on vacation anyway</p>
