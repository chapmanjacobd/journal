Most of the things that I download come from YouTube, Reddit, or InternetArchive. 

I have one database which has all the metadata related to the download (created via `library tubeadd`, `redditadd`, or `galleryadd`) and one database which is just file metadata (created via `library fsadd`). The second database isn't 100% necessary in my case but it helps to know which files were on a failed drive without needing to rescan all the other drives.
