<p>Milosovic / collapse of Yugoslavia</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was curious and found this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmBevvAFa4">The Fall of Milosevic 2001, Chapter 3: Finished</a>. It seems like Yugoslavia was a bit more unified against the incumbent compared to the United States today. I feel like Americans are a bit more selfish and there is more capacity for long-term harm before the majority of people are starving but maybe the current admin is not patient enough to pull this off "correctly".</p>
<p>However, I can definitely see parallels between <em>this</em> and <em>that</em>.</p>
<p>I think something like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide">Cambodian Genocide</a> (where 25% of the population was killed) is the worst case but I hope that something like that happening again is unlikely. <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18uqoek/cmv_under_a_trump_dictatorship_there_would_be_a/">We don't want to believe it</a> but it <a href="https://www.telospress.com/on-genocidal-dictators-and-totalitarian-states/">probably will happen</a>.</p>
