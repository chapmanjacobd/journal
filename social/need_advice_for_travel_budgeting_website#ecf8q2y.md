Thanks for your detailed feedback!

You have a lot of valid points. I'm trying to balance information overload with UI simplicity. The decisions I have to make are sometimes very hard.

I think I could do a cost breakdown on the summary page that I'm designing, but I'd like to know how would seeing the breakdown of the data actually change the decisions that you will make?

I use a simple consumer bundle / cost of living indexes to create one number (which as of right now it is really only useful for budget solo travelers). I think once you compare the total that I put together with your own spending you can see how over or under the prediction is for you and compensate the total for your spending to have a more accurate idea of how much it would cost.

Maybe I can publish the consumer bundle that I use on a FAQ page or something... The problem is that everyone spends different things while living or traveling. I think the cost of living variance won't be very much more accurate unless I make the website really complicated and ask people a bunch of invasive questions about how much alcohol they buy, etc.

I'm always looking and thinking of ways to make this more accurate but I really feel like having a questionnaire with a bunch of options is not the way to go. If public transport is good then I use that number. Using your example of the Philippines or other more developing countries oftentimes the route of public transport, like jeepneys, is not well published or confusing if you aren't a local of that area so I use the cost of a taxi in that case for my calculation. I think something like Numbeo would be more helpful in getting a breakdown of costs like that... with UNLI TravelPlanner I'd rather people discover new cities and destinations than focus on specifics.

The cost per day includes the basic cost of living like two meals at a cheap restaurant, a bed at a hostel, and the price of a flight ticket divided by the number of days of the trip segment. The next feature that I'm working on is adding a 'comfort slider' so that you can tell the app to not include shared room hostels in the calculation and it will only use private rooms or short term apartments depending on how long your stay is
