Text taken from a google doc somewhere:

    Avoid the MARB, that building stinks to sit in. The seats are too close together.
    Tanner is awesome. Blue Line cafe is alright, get the el gallo gordo or something like that. 
    JFSB Good building, classes aren’t cramped.
    Take religion from Todd(?) Parker and Matthew Grey. Parker is good and easy, and Grey will teach you SO MUCH 
    HBLL - There is a place where they play classical music. You can reserve rooms beforehand for group work. Get a QR code scanner on your phone to easily check room availability. You can rent some sweet cameras and stuff from the fourth floor somewhere. 
    Testing Center - straightforward. As you go into the main room, go left and go almost to the wall and there is a staircase that leads upstairs where they play classical music while you take tests. I liked it.
    The Smith Fieldhouse - Go here to lift. I think the better side of the gym is closed until like 6 everyday, so go after that. There is a tunnel to the RB if it is butt-cold or something. I would shower here if I took the weightlifting class so I wouldn’t have to come all the way home.
    The RB - sign up for intramurals here. Besides normal stuff you are interested in, I would try to get on an inner-tube water polo team. Way fun. You can also swim here for exercise.
    There is a path on the south side of campus I like to walk. Just above the duck pond. Nice and relaxing. Especially when the creek is going.
