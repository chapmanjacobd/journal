<p>Today I watched <em>Tampopo</em> (1985), yesterday I watched <em>An Actor's Revenge</em> (1963), and three days ago I watched <em>Woman in Witness Protection</em> (1997).</p>
<p><em>Tampopo</em> is okay. It has some famous meme-y scenes which take place in the same universe but aren't related to the story in any way. Maybe they offer some comic relief or maybe some visual action to keep any babies watching glued to the tube. It's a decent film but mostly forgettable. I think the funniest part is the credits where the background is a woman nursing in the park--is it a social experiment to see if an exposed breast is enough to get people to stay in their seats while the credit rolls? Only kamisama knows...</p>
<p><em>An Actor's Revenge</em> is a very beautiful film and I highly recommend it. It's not perfect but I really enjoyed it!!</p>
<p><em>Woman in Witness Protection</em>. Wow! Great script. I think this is one of the best films I've seen all year. It is a bit campy and it parodies itself but it makes it feel very authentic and real.</p>
