<p>Over the past few days, I've been spending some time extracting tables from PDF documents published by the U.S. Department of State with statistics about the issuance of Immigration Visas.</p>
<p>I've been wanting to make a "git-scraping" project for some time so I'm glad I was able to find something that I was somewhat interested in. It was fun to refresh some of my R knowledge too.</p>
