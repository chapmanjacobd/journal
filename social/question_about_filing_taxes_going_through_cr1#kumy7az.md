I don't think it is allowed but if FreeTaxUSA re-used it from the main flow (the separate pages for generating the tax forms) for the extension application, it "works" but I don't *know* if it should have.

The extension application asked if I was filing as Single, MFS, MFJ, etc but it didn't ask any details beyond that (within the extension application flow). If the data that they sent to the IRS contained the placeholder SSN, perhaps either: 

- the IRS does not do very deep validation before accepting the tax extension (which makes sense to me, I don't think filing an extension needs to be more tedious than it already is)
- or they use it as a placeholder (I think this is somewhat unlikely) 
- or they accepted it by mistake (I think this is somewhat unlikely as well)
