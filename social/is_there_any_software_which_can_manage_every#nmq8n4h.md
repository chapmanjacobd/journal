[CLZ](https://clz.com/), [Eric's Movie DataBase](https://www.emdb.eu/) and [mymovies.dk](https://mymovies.dk/products/collection-management.aspx) are still maintained and kind of similar to [Delicious Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delicious_Library). 

There's also [iCollect](https://www.icollecteverything.com/2024/05/03/mac-app-updated-with-new-powerful-sort-options/), [GCStar](https://gitlab.com/GCstar/GCstar), [Librarian Pro](https://www.koingosw.com/products/librarianpro/), [ryot](https://github.com/IgnisDa/ryot), medialib.net... I wrote a CLI tool, [library](https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/library), to search media metadata from _files_ but it's not a general purpose cataloguing app (like for scanning physical books on bookshelves).

For books specifically, [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) is one of the best tools out there--though online tools like LibraryThing, Libib, StoryGraph, Letterboxd, GoodReads, are really popular--if you use them just be sure to export your data often. Along the same lines are mobile-only apps like [Book Tracker](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/book-tracker-reading-journal/id1496543317)...

Or just use a spreadsheet!
