I think this all goes back to the development of safety methods research caused by the three-mile island incident

> Views of ‘cause’ limit the effectiveness of defenses against future events.

> Post-accident remedies for “human error” are usually predicated on obstructing activities
that can “cause” accidents. These end-of-the-chain measures do little to reduce the
likelihood of further accidents. In fact that likelihood of an identical accident is already
extraordinarily low because the pattern of latent failures changes constantly. Instead of
increasing safety, post-accident remedies usually increase the coupling and complexity of the system. This increases the potential number of latent failures and also makes the
detection and blocking of accident trajectories more difficult.
