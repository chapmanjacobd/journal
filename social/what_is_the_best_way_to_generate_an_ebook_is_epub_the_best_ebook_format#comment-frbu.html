<p>ePub is "just" zipped HTML with some additional metadata so any well-formatted web <em>document</em> should be able to become an ePub pretty easily</p>
<p>Out of all the tools that I've tried I've always had pretty good results with Calibre's ebook-convert tool which supports a lot of different input and output formats.</p>
<p>My advice would be to unzip an ePub file that you like (fixed layout or reflowable) and see how they built it (similar to how you can "view source" on the web).</p>
<p>eg. <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/louis-h-sullivan/the-autobiography-of-an-idea">https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/louis-h-sullivan/the-autobiography-of-an-idea</a></p>
