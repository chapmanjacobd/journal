<p>I got into performance fabrics through the onebag and Ultralight subreddits around 2017. Before that I would often wear <a href="https://shirt.woot.com/catalog">woot.com graphic tees</a> which are still pretty funny but don't quite hit the way they did with my adolescent brain.</p>
<p>The qualities of cotton can vary wildly. I was looking for more consistency. The odour resistance of wool is a nice bonus.</p>
<p>I've since realized that durability can still vary quite a bit between manufacturers and between batches regardless of the specific material. The quality of the raw material matters a lot.</p>
<p>Nowadays, I'm less skeptical of cotton. I focus more on comfort than durability. Wool feels a bit scratchy at times but I still prefer it for socks and underwear.</p>
