Thanks for the feedback!

This is the first time I've posted this on reddit. You might be confusing this site with another one--unless you saw it on Tildes!

The latest version of the site should have fewer false positives. I often comb through the results as well. You could [flag the listing on eBay](https://community.ebay.com/t5/Ask-a-Mentor/People-keep-falsely-flagging-my-listing-Can-the-listing-be/td-p/32557167) if it is not in the right category. 

If you see anything specific over and over feel free to comment or DM here!
