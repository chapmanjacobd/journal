I would download the HTML first then use something like Calibre's [ebook-convert](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/generated/en/ebook-convert.html#html-input-options) to convert the HTML to [markdown](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/generated/en/ebook-convert.html#txt-output-options) ie. `--txt-output-formatting markdown`.

But I would like to recommend converting to something like ePub or OEB because there are more interfaces that support opening those types of files with the links intact... ePub _is_ just zipped HTML but this makes site archives more uniform but removing javascript, etc at the risk of interactivity and information loss! You can always convert to markdown the moment before reading the page so maybe it is best to leave things as-is for long-term retrieval purposes! If you're using this as input data to train a model, I'd still recommend leaving the files AS-IS -- that way you can make incremental improvements on the markdown parsing when needed!
