<p>Indeed, it is surprising to me how uncomfortable it is to build something for mobile platforms while on a mobile platform. Even ignoring the problem of small screens and small keyboards... the development tooling isn't quite there yet.</p>
<p>I'm somewhat skeptical (but still hopeful) that <em>App Dev for All</em> can make a difference here. The reason they are targeting Android as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting_(compilers)">self-hosting</a> development platform is because they feel that it is necessary to empower marginalized (third-world) communities because they don't have laptops <em>but they do have old phones</em>. I think this idea that Africa (et al.) doesn't have good internet access is rapidly becoming outdated (especially as <em>developed</em> countries disinvest in infrastructure upgrades and maintenance). But it is still neat that they are attempting to give the world more options for end-user programming.</p>
<p>Another interesting project in this same space is <a href="https://github.com/termux/termux-gui?tab=readme-ov-file">Termux:GUI</a>. This is a relatively new thing (it is completely different from <a href="https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Graphical_Environment">Termux X11</a>).</p>
