For most problems you don't actually need a General Purpose Language and you can easily learn to overengineer every problem that you are solving. For sure GPLs are necessary, but I feel like their use is misguided for many problems.

Learn about domain driven design, DSLs like SQL, CSS (there are plenty of gamified learn CSS tools like flexboz frogger), Fish Shell.

Then once you have a solid idea of what a DSL should look like you should learn how to make them using Racket, Haskell, or TypeScript. Only use General Programming Languages to construct DSLs. It may not be the easiest thing at first but it will help with learning to think with abstraction and macros.

You can live your whole life and never touch OOP or you can do the opposite and only learn Pharo. There is not much benefit other than curiousity once you deeply know a paradigm thoroughly. You can do anything in both paradigms but the idea is to stick with it.
