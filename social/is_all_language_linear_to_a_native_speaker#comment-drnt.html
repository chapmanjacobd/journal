<p>but at least it usually follows subject - verb - object order, which not every language does</p>

<p>I learned a verb–subject–object language to relative fluency and I agree with what you've written here. You get used to the difference of order and after that it doesn't really affect how you "linearly" you can process sentences after that.</p>
<p>It's interesting to note that while languages do have a dominant word ordering, many languages use one or more alternate orderings for playful or emphatic use like poetry or casual conversation.</p>
<p>In Tagalog for example you can put actor focus or the object focus first to emphasize that it was a specific person doing something or a specific object that was acted upon:</p>
