well yeah if you see the culture as restrictive then don't live there permanently. just live in a few different places. The only problem that you might have is regarding your tax domicile. Being a US Citizen it's likely you will have to pay taxes to the US unless you give up your citizenship. IANAL but in some cases even if you live somewhere outside the US for more than 183 days you will lose an investigation into your tax domicile.

In other news, South Korea is a really nice place. You should be visit Busan or Tongyeong sometime
