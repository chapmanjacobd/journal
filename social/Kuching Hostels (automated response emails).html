  Iâ€™ve decided to switch it up a little bit and stay at 10 different hostels for 3 nights while Iâ€™m in Kuching. I will compare all of them here:

 <p>
  So far the booking process for each of them has been pretty much the same. The costs are very similar between $3 to $5 per night.
 </p>
 <p>
  The automated response emails were a bit different though:
 </p>
 <p>
  #1: QuiikCat
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>

  </p>
  <p>
   Dear Jacob,
  </p>
  <p>
   Public transport from the Airport to Quiikcat(15min by car) :
  </p>
  <p>
   i. you can request a grab taxi (RM10 to RM15)
  </p>
  <p>
   ii. or need to walk (10 min walking) from the airport to kuching sentral and take a bus(RM2.00) bus number 3A, 6, 4B, 2, K3, K6, K9, 10A (kuching sentral to city center). The last bus is 5.30pm ðŸ™‚
  </p>
  <p>
   iii. Quiikcat Transport services (Airport-Quiikcat) - RM 35
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  This one was definitely the most helpful. It is the only hostel that sent information about public transportation so I really like that. Depending on how I feel I might take a grab taxi since itâ€™s not too expensive and walking with luggage is a pain; but I really appreciate seeing that option. I also really like that they included the time of the last bus. This is crucial decision-making information.
 </p>

  #2: Check In Lodge
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>

  This one is also very helpful because they reminded me to download the Grab app. But I already told them my expected arrival time in my initial bookingâ€¦

  This one included some useful information but there was just too much information. If I was a normal person I wouldnâ€™t have enough time to read all this. Maybe they shouldâ€™ve shortened it to one or two sentences that they have connections with some tourism services and that they are very happy to help plan your trip with you. Just send us a message and weâ€™ll email you some additional information, etc.

  This is a pretty standard message and most hostels donâ€™t send a message at all. I specified a booking time in my initial booking yet they still ask for an ETA. Itâ€™s not a good message because it doesnâ€™t provide me with any additional information about the area.
 </p>
 <p>
  For me, too much information is much better than not enough information but for other people this may not be the case.
