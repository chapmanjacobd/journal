<p>there's a way to configure eg bash to be more POSIX-compliant</p>

<p>It was mostly a joke. If anything, the things I like are not quite POSIX compliant.</p>
<p>re: bash, yes there is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When bash is started in posix mode, as with the --posix command line option,  it        follows  the POSIX standard for startup files.  In this mode, interactive shells        expand the ENV variable and commands are read and executed from the  file  whose name is the expanded value.  No other startup files are read.</p>

<p>I mostly use fish shell though. On Windows I use nushell ðŸ˜Ž</p>
