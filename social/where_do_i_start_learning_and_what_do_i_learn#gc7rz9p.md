My background is also Humanities/Anthropology

I would start with learning fish shell and writing and piping functions with stdin, stdout to solve some of your daily tasks. Once you have an idea about what data flow feels like then you can learn category theory from Bartosz; Elixir, OCaml, FP TypeScript

Elm is a nice intro to FP because the e compiler is often helpful and the community on slack is really helpful
