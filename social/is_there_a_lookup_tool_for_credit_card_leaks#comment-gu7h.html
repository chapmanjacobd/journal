<p>It's annoying to wait for a new card in the mail but you shouldn't be financially exposed in this situation anyway. It can help to use intermediary services like Google Wallet, PayPal, or pay in full Klarna, etc.</p>
<p>Some other ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your bank might offer a way to generate temporary credit card numbers like Revolut, Citi, or Capital One's Virtual Credit Cards</li>
<li>If not, <a href="https://www.privacy.com/pricing">Privacy.com</a> allows you to generate 12 card numbers per month for free(?; I've never used it personally but it seems to be reasonably popular)</li>
</ul>
<p>I love the brutal honesty on this page:</p>

<p>Why do people use virtual cards?<br/>
When you’re shopping online and your wallet is in the other room</p>

<p>Large banks have gotten very good at finding sources of stolen card numbers through data science. I wouldn't worry about their losses when they refund the unauthorized charges.</p>
<p>I think the best way to deal with the annoying 1-2 weeks without a card is to just have more cards. As long as you can keep track of all of them, opening accounts can be a good way to earn some pocket money via <a href="https://www.doctorofcredit.com/best-current-credit-card-sign-bonuses/">sign-up bonuses</a>--at least in the US, in other countries maybe it's not quite as crazy</p>
