<p>I used Antigravity/Gemini CLI to turn the retirement monte carlo simulation python script that I made last week into a lightweight singlepage app: <a href="https://unli.xyz/rforecast/">https://unli.xyz/rforecast/</a></p>
<p>Gemini is fun to use for web development as long as you do it incrementally and keep <code>git add --patch</code> handy ;)</p>
<p>The site itself is unfortunately likely US centric--I hope other countries' retirement plans and social safety nets aren't as fucked up to need a complex visualization tool to be able to decide where to store $5,000.</p>
<p>Doing all this made me realize that the Social Security program is actually pretty darn good and I don't get why boomers complain about it.</p>
<p>It also made me realize that the yearly limitations on IRA contributions are pretty ridiculous. It effectively makes them only useful as intermediary vehicles. It's especially ridiculous when you understand that there are ways to build a Roth IRA with a balance in the billions. The bullshit complexity subsidizes the accountant, taxes, and retirement industry--which is perhaps the only good thing about it.</p>
