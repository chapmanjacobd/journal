<p>Ah yes Gen AI is an interesting lens. When I was reading it I thought about street art and public art where the authorship of something is not widely known.</p>
<p>Public art which lacks attribution often belongs more to a place than to any individual and as long as it is not controversial itself people don't immediately think to critique it nor do they doubt that it is authentic. People don't go out of their way to verify that it was <em>authorized</em> to be installed where it is.</p>
<p>Likewise when Gen AI causes harm there isn't really an outlet for critique due to lack of authorship. That is, the model v83474383 cannot be publicly "cancelled". The lack of attribution makes it on a similar level to Holy Text and it should not be doubted--only interpreted through wizened eyes...</p>
<p>back to the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While some claims for authorship may be as simple as a renewed sense of responsibility, at times they seem to be ploys for property rights, attempts to finally exercise some kind of agency where traditionally there has been none. The author = authority. The longing for graphic authorship may be the longing for a kind of legitimacy, or a kind of power that has so long eluded the obedient designer. But do we get anywhere by celebrating the designer as some central character? Isn’t that what fueled the last fifty years of design history? If we really want to move beyond the designer-ashero model of history, we may have to imagine a time when we can ask, “What difference does it make who designed it?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my mind the lack of authorship makes the art even more sacrosanct (or at least more... fragile?). Like a lost item in the place that it was lost (and not within the confines of a "lost &amp; found" bin where it almost feels like something profane and dirty). Public art, public domain, and Gen AI can feel like both extremes of this spectrum.</p>
