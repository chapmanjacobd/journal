Beyond 10,000 files I feel like you need to adopt library science. Keeping it simple makes sense but I have found that keeping filenames AS-IS has some benefits: 

- Save time (don't need to spend time renaming or moving files)
- Can be easier to figure out provenance (if not originally recorded)
- No regrets if you decide the previous naming scheme has flaws

Deduplication is still possible. You could have an Excel sheet where you have the paths, author_name, title, etc. Or use something like Zotero or xklb to catalog everything.

Filesystems are good at many things but searching file trees is usually pretty slow with the exception of NTFS which keeps an index https://www.voidtools.com/support/everything/using_everything/
