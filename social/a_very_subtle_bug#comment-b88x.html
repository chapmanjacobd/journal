<p>maybe... although if we copy paste some text from the article into a GenAI tool like Claude:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The following code snippet in Python is intended to extract and return a single file from a tarball:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It provides an answer that uses <code>tarfile</code> and avoids calling <code>subprocess</code>. Although it makes a couple minor mistakes it would have avoided above bug.</p>
<p>And it would have exited after returning the first file: something that the author's subprocess version does not do but which seems to be the original intention of the author--although maybe they were initially unaware that Tar files can contain multiple files with the same names [most archiving tools expose only the latest version of the file in a UI]. Although, I'm not sure about the actual implementation details of <code>tar.getmembers()</code> and <code>tar.extract()</code>--just what the python code looks like it is doing.</p>
