<p>I think you meant to reply to <a class="link-user" href="/user/GOTO10">@GOTO10</a> but I'm curious about this too. The information on <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/465076/what-part-of-the-terminal-stack-is-responsible-for-the-direction-of-text-being-o/465166">this page</a> explains why it is not a simple thing to have done but I also don't want to discourage you from playing around!</p>
<p>However, my advice is this: use printf first instead of trying to get it right the first time. It's easier to run printf a bunch of times than it is to recover from a broken $PS1</p>
<p>I also use Kitty and I wonder if something like this wouldn't be possible to implement inside of a <a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/kittens_intro/">Kitty kitten</a>. If not, it might be easier to hack a simpler terminal like st or foot</p>
