Well... you're not likely to get a manufacturing job in HK unless you are a small business owner or have a very specific skill like a type of welding that only you know how to do.

Chinese people have a very good attention to detail when there is enough feedback in the system (QC) and many will do the job for HK$8K per month. It's difficult to compete with that kind of labor market less than one hour away (Shenzhen).

On the other hand, there are more places in the EU that pay a _livable wage_ for blue-collar labor. Though many HKer can communicate in English, I believe slightly more people in the EU understand and speak English fluently.

But I concede that finding work overseas is rarely straightforward.
