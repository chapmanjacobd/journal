<p>I haven't played Wasteland 2 actually, but maybe I'll start it and see how it goes--or <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Wasteland2/comments/2wjcbq/wasteland_2_or_fallout_tactics_bos/">maybe I should try Fallout Tactics</a> again? The gameplay of Tactics was decent but I lost interest after the first few missions. It seems like Wasteland 2 is more story-driven which is what I'm interested in</p>
