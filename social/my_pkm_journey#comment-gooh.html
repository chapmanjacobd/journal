<p>On one hand, I need reminders, due dates, and the UX to make sure that I don't miss certain tasks. On the other hand I need to be able to categorize and view all recorded entities</p>

<p>This seems really specific. Have you tried <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Org-mode">Org-mode</a>? I don't personally use emacs but this multiplicity (task management+event management) seems like something that would only be satisfied by very mature systems which have been actively developed over decades.</p>

<p>what application and system do you use?</p>

<p>Personally, I use Google Calendar and Gmail snooze email for things I want to remember/schedule. But I also use systemd-timers, eg:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/computer/blob/main/.config/fish/functions/systemd-cron.fish">systemd-cron.fish</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/computer/blob/main/.config/systemd/user/epic_games_free.timer">epic_games_free.timer</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For note-taking I primarily use git, ie. <a href="https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/journal/">https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/journal/</a></p>
<p>There isn't really anything specific in terms of programs. I do a couple things to manage and sort lists--but all the note-taking and searching is very lightweight: tee, ripgrep, fd, etc.</p>
