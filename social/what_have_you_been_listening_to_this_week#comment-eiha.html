<blockquote>
<p>You, the vandal, plunder the village as you will.<br/>
The earthworm will pillage you, the vandal, when you are under.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A quiet whisper of justice that rings empty because the dead feel nothing<br/>
A false comfort cannot soothe the outrage of injustice<br/>
Natureâ€™s indifferent cycle, a process that neither rewards nor punishes...</p>
