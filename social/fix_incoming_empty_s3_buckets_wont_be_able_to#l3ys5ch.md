Looks like that is free too: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ErrorCodeBilling.html

Given the variety of free error codes... I wonder if you could use this to build a free storage system: 404 == `011001`, 403 == `001001`, etc (but the overhead of TCP packet size is pretty bad, overhead of 20 bytes at least)
