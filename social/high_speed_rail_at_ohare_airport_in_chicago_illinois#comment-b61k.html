<p>It might be interesting to note that O'Hare already has train service <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/BetUM1baWaeVwAF97">only a block away from the MMF</a>. But one of the major problems is that trains only stop there on weekdays, NO holidays, and only 6 trains per day. The infrequency causes people to not consider it as a serious option. It seems somewhat irresponsible that the people in the video do not make mention of the existing infrastructure and how or why it can't be improved. While HSR is ideal it's not like everyone will just start taking the train. HSR is really only possible because people are already using the train.</p>
