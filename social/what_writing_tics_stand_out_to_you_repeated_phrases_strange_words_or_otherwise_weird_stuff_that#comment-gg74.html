<p>Perhaps it's just that its use at the start or end of a statement--feels very weird to me. Something like this doesn't feel that strange:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's <em>not for nothing</em> they tell you to fill your gas tank before you go into the desert</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe it's just that I can more naturally intuit the reason for why you should fill your gas tank. If you don't know or can't imagine the reason why--maybe it is more useful to state what is obvious to you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You should fill up your gas tank before you go into the desert because there aren't many gas stations out there</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Takes only a few more words and it gives people the actual reason.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's not for nothing that we climbed that mountain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the same way this feels like it is lacking information. To me it sounds like "We climbed that mountain for a reason" where the reason was previously discussed or will be discussed. "It was not in vain that we climbed that mountain"; it sounds like a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sfXfUEAE4I">pep talk</a>. If the intent is to convey that it was worthwhile why not say, "It was great that we climbed that mountain--let's do it again some time" ?</p>
