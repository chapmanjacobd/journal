<p>For sure. I think they didn't have enough momentum and kind of fizzled out? Perhaps delayed and flawed by perfectionism. Every.org seems to have taken the opposite approach but now it is a platform with actual active users. It would be interesting if they could experiment with monetary instruments like cooperative donating, etc.</p>
<p>I like the work that <a href="https://numfocus.org/">https://numfocus.org/</a> is doing. I think there is some hope for <a href="https://opencollective.com/collectives">collective</a> style of non-profit administration. But a lot of volunteers and non-profits don't have the time, prestige, or the portfolio to onboard with a successful collective. I write open-source software and I really enjoy doing it. It's a lot more fun than applying for jobs and hearing nothing back so I'll probably just keep doing it regardless of <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/chapmanjacobd">donations</a> and the number of lentils in my cupboard.</p>
