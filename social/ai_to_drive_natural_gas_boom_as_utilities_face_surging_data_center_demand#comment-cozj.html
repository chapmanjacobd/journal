<p>It is somewhat interesting to note that these facilities <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivanpah_Solar_Power_Facility#Fossil_fuel_consumption">also use natural gas</a> for energy conversion efficiency. That's not to say they are a step in the wrong direction--just that I was surprised to read it. They use enough natural gas to be <em>only</em> 3 times more efficient than a traditional Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) plant.</p>
