<p>Last week I filed taxes. The wife and I keep separate accounts for the most part and just reconcile our accounts once per year. It's not too bad but it did give me a chance to try a few new programs:</p>
<p><a href="https://kmymoney.org/">KMyMoney</a> is pretty good! But I was annoyed that I couldn't easily change the category of payees in bulk (you have to set a default and then export and re-import all the transactions). This led me to export everything and start over in <a href="https://skrooge.org/">Skrooge</a>--which I like pretty well. I was surprised by how many banks and cards still don't offer OFX exports but most had QIF or at least CSV. I used <code>xsv cat rows</code> a few times to join CSV files for banks that only offered monthly instead of yearly exports...</p>
<p>The UI for exporting transactions in SoFi Credit Card is completely awful. It led me to decide to close all my accounts with them. They only offer up to 60 days in CSV export via datepicker and you need to manually click the dates. Which would be... fine. But the dates can't cross year boundaries(!?) And it always resets to TODAY so you need to click like 24 times to go back to 01/01/2024. Then click 22 times to click 03/01/2024... and worst of all the CSS of the datepicker is such that depending on the length of the name of the month (or perhaps the number of days in the month) the next/previous month buttons will move so you can't just click 24 times. You need to move the mouse up and down as the button position changes... incredibly aggravating!</p>
<p>I figured out how to <code>Inspect-&gt;Network tab-&gt;Edit and Resend</code> and tweak the URL params to manually kick off a different month request which was a lot easier. But! Even with this the API would give back HTTP 429 Too Many Requests after only a few requests and it took a few minutes to reset. Meanwhile you can load the non-CSV transactions view and it loads everything in a couple pages so it's not like it's a lot of data... Completely bizarre.</p>
<p>This financial <em>bender</em> led me, this week, to try to understand more about taxes and retirement accounts. I've been getting into Solo 401(k) recently. I'm not making anywhere near to where the extra paperwork makes any sense to do (compared to SEP-IRA) but it's turned into something of a temporary hobby.</p>
