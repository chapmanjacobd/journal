<p>Huh! I first read the marketing taunts in the video ("Infinite ways to die...", "There's always better ways to die") as the purpose of the game is to die. Like you rack up points by dying faster as a novel game mechanic. But this reading conflicts with the "where you kill enemies, collect gold, and avoid the Reaper long enough to pay the Ferrymanʼs exorbitant river-crossing fee" sidebar text. So I guess not...</p>
<p>But there's probably a game like that somewhere out there... and that seems more interesting than running away from a pacman ghost</p>
