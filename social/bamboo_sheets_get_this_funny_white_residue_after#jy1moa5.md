I can't see the imgur images (because I downloaded like a 15 million images last month and they blocked me) but I think I have the same problem. I really love my bamboo sheets and I have a few of them.

Are these by chance  Royal Tradition Viscose? The Sea color ones smell kind of weird even after washing them. But the red colored ones don't have this problem
