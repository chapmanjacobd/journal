<p>selecting individual records</p>

<p>I think they meant when writing the select statement you are referencing individual <em>values</em> like "city.name" instead of "cities.name". I agree this shouldn't be dogmatic <em>but it should be consistent</em> (whenever possible) to minimize confusion. I've preferred to always use plurals and I never had second thoughts about "cities.name".</p>
<p>But I agree, it's not a <em>strong</em> tip like the others are.</p>
