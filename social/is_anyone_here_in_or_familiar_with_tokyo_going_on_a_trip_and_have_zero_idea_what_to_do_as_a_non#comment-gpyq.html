<p>I would prefer to stay in one place the entire trip</p>

<p>I would recommend somewhere near Shimbashi or Kanda station because both are well-connected but not too crazy busy--or if you plan on going to Shinjuku or Shibuya a lot just stay near there.</p>

<p>Go spend an hour watching live Rakugo at one of the many theatres--even if you don't understand Japanese it's fun to watch--Asakusa is as fine a place as any to do this.</p>
