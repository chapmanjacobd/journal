<p>I follow <a href="https://mastodon.social/@xk3/following">around 500 people</a> and am relatively happy with what I see in Mastodon but I also don't use Mastodon much. It can be an echo chamber at times--but other times I am pleasantly surprised with some of the diversity of opinion that I see.</p>
