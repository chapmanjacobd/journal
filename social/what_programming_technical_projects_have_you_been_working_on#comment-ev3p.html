<p>If you haven't tried <a href="https://github.com/rockdaboot/wget2">wget2</a>... it's pretty good. I've been background-busy the past couple weeks buying cheap hard drives (SAS 3TB are easily found for $15 and cheaper, including shipping) and downloading small websites. There are really so many websites out there but the <del>hegemony</del> dominance of social media sites which de-prioritize links (or at least unverified domains <em>in relation to</em> the verified and thus prioritized) has kinda killed discoverability.</p>
<p>One such site that I'm rediscovering is <a href="http://glasswings.com/bigindex.html">Glass Works</a>. Lots of interesting content and comics here! You could get lost in there for a few months before you realize that you don't know where the exit is and now you're trapped inside someone else's mind-library (though it is not as scary (branching.... multicursal) as <a href="https://app.thebrain.com/brain/498e34f8-61e2-c7af-70b7-7e8281379166/501da001-450d-5c05-aa36-a5b994e7de64">this one</a>).</p>
