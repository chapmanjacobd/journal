<p>Here is a brilliant film that highlights the economic incentives for hate through a very simple story:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An inept Slovak peasant is torn between greed and guilt when the Nazi-backed bosses of his town appoint him “Aryan controller” of an old Jewish widow’s button shop. Humor and tragedy fuse in this scathing exploration of one cowardly man’s complicity in the horrors of a totalitarian regime. Made near the height of Soviet oppression in Czechoslovakia, The Shop on Main Street features intense editing and camera work which won it the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film in 1965.</p>
<p>Winner of the 1965 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Ida Kamińska was nominated one year later for Best Actress in a Leading Role. At the 1965 Cannes Film Festival, Ida Kamińska and Jozef Kroner received special mentions by the jury.</p>
