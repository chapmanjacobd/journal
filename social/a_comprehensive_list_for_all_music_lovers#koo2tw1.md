I wrote something which probably fits in there. It's a CLI offline audio/video player. Cross-platform, even works on Android via Termux. It's also a tracker (it will add new tracks from online channels/playlists) and music downloader. And it uses catt to cast the same playlists to chromecast. At the very least it is worth linking to catt:
