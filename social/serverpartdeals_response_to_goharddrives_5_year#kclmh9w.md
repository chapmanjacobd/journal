The hard drives are made out of bundles of 1TiB driftwood.... :o

Or it could be that the owners already have a stable business recycling drives but they want to expand into the competitive aquarium decor business. [Something fishy](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/fish-tank-31122)...

I'm not _too_ worried. A hard drive is a hard drive. If significantly more GHD disks failed early compared to other resellers their eBay rating and sales volume wouldn't be nearly as good as it seems to be. Whether or not it is money laundry it seems like they have enough cash flow to cover any RMAs... at least until they suddenly pivot to a stuffed animal distributor.
