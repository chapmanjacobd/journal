<p>I take ideas</p>

<p>I like Rust too but I'm still pretty new to it. Fish shell was recently ported to Rust. Maybe you could add a PR to that. It is really easy to build and edit. I really have no idea what I'm doing and I was able to add a feature to fish shell <a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10738">mostly by myself</a>.</p>
<p>I also ported my "<a href="https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/library/blob/main/library/text/cluster_sort.py">cluster sort</a>" idea <a href="https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/clustersort/blob/main/src/main.rs">to Rust</a>. It works but it is slower than the python version. I'm sure it could potentially be faster, if there was more optimization done at the linfa layer... Python's numpy is <em>heavily</em> optimized.</p>
<p>You might try creating a Rust version of "<a href="https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/library/blob/main/library/text/regex_sort.py">regex sort</a>" and maybe change the name to something better at the same time... maybe "sentence sort"? idk.... But I think regex-sort could be faster in Rust without much work. A lot of it is very simple.</p>
<p>I've also wanted to experiment with a Rust version of the <a href="https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/library#getting-started">media aspects of library</a> with maybe a web interface since that is what most people seem to want. But I lack the time. Or even a CLI version that experiments with embedding postgres instead of using SQLite. Or maybe a rust version that compiles to wasm and also uses pglite and runs inside the browser...? Let me know if you proceed with any of those ideas and I'll be happy to be your <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umarell">Umarell</a></em>.</p>
