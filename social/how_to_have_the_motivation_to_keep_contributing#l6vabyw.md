I agree it is difficult to keep working on something when it seems like no one cares. This is especially difficult when you're trying to create a product which has no alternatives (or at least popular ones). In addition to the responsibility of making sure the code works and is maintainable, you also have to be really good at community organizing and marketing. You're essentially creating a new market--and anyone can tell you that doing _that_ is difficult.

I think the solution here is to code just enough to solve your own problems. Don't worry about other people. Try to keep things simple and not too generic.

Software is a perpetual state of devaluation because the majority of it deteriorates faster than light. Everything eventually becomes dust.
