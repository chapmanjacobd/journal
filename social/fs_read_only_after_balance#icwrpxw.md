yeah I can't help ya there... many linux distributions split initramfs into different parts mostly due to size so your wifi drivers might not be loaded. I don't think it's as simple as modprobe and then starting up nm.service but I've never tried. running from a read-only OS compounds the issue. I would just give up until you have LiveUSB. But you could also look up how they create LiveUSB because LiveCD is a read-only system. They probably create a tmpfs ramdisk as the write sink for the OS but I don't know how all that works
