> cheaper is the priority

For that quantity of data you need to consider multiple constraints. There are off the shelf solutions for that quantity of data but they are usually in the $10K~$20K range. You'll want to have a backup of each file so I would double your estimate. 

If losing a day here and there to restore from backups would be detrimental to your project you should also consider using RAID10 so that would increase your footage estimate again (150-210 TB) but I'm assuming you will either forgo RAID or backups so ~120 TB

Most desktop motherboards max out at 6 or 8 SATA ports so you'll want to check how many you have or build a server/PC to accommodate the drives. Or get something like Synology with 8 or more Bays.

Hard drive prices are pretty good right now. Anything below $10/TB is a good deal. Larger TBs means less wattage to run, and more opportunity to upgrade later if you have extra empty bays but it also means you lose more data when a drive fails.

I would buy 7 of these: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BSZL39NH?psc=1 

So about $1450 for hard drives plus another ~$1,000 for a 7+ bay Synology to store the drives in if you go the RAID10 route. Or two ~$500 4+ bay Synologys
