<p>Here's my setup script: <a href="https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/computer/tree/main/.github/Windows/#setup">https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/computer/tree/main/.github/Windows/#setup</a></p>
<p>#1 tip: use scoop as much as possible. There's also choco, ninite, WinGet... which are pretty good but scoop is simpler and therefore more robust. Scoop is popular because it doesn't require admin rights so it works even on most locked-down corporate machines. Setup a weekly <code>tasksched.msc</code> task to run <code>scoop.cmd update --all</code></p>
<p>I tried out a lot of terminals on Windows and liked WezTerm the most but vtm and Windows Terminal are also decent. Also nushell is an excellent alternative to cmd.exe and even PowerShell (unless you are already very comfortable with writing PowerShell scripts--then keep using PS!)</p>
<p>(I love GNU/Linux userspace but I'm very sensitive to the latency in WSL and would rather use nushell than run WSL when running Windows. But, disclaimer, I've only used Windows for two months these past five years--usually I'm using Fedora Linux / Kitty terminal / fish shell)</p>
