<p>Last year [2021], the Smithsonian developed Open Access, a dataset with over 3 million objects from their collections for public use on the internet. Using today’s technology we can bring these objects to you in surprising ways.</p>
<p>After you write something, the application responds with images from Open Access.</p>
<p>Sound good? Then let’s go.</p>
<p>This project supports writing in Chinese, English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish.</p>
