I think many Japanese, especially the older generation, imagine tourists as only tour groups because that is the only way they would want to go to a foreign country. They feel secure in the group so I'm not surprised they are surprised the numbers are low--just surprised that they don't compare the tour group numbers pre and post covid--those numbers are probably harder to come by but they could be inferred from tax records
