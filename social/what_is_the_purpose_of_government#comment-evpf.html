<p>Also, there is another aspect that is usually regarded as subjective but could be more objective: what is the optimal path from where we are now to where we want to go?</p>
<p>It's like operating a power plant. Move too fast and too far and you risk wasting excess power or causing a power vacuum and everything collapsing in on itself. Move too slow and nothing seems to happen and you lose support in the next election. While the merits of control, anarchy, market-worship, and state-worship can be debated there is likely an optimal path that can be taken during the exploration of contradictory avenues--a dialectical vector: speed and angle.</p>
<p>But I guess this is just another aspect of social contract. Whether or not the baby-murdering machine actually exists you could still believe that it does and scream that it should be shut down immediately at the expense of everything else. I suppose this is the meta-meta wherein we are subject to the limits of the collective imagination--perhaps we are more at the whims of radical individuals than we would like to believe. If <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montesquieu">Montesquieu</a> did not exist, I think the world would look quite a bit different.</p>
