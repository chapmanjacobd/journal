Multiple copies stored in HDDs will be cheaper than one copy of data in SSDs. SSDs will not always fail in read-only ways. They can still fail in unusual ways.

Warm storage is less likely to bitrot than cold storage.

If you need the data, have backups. 

If downtime is expensive, use RAID. 

If you don't care about the data that much, and if your definition of "economic" includes business downtime and data loss, there are [hobby alternatives](https://github.com/trapexit/mergerfs-tools/issues/39#issuecomment-1414592026) to RAID5/6 or SnapRAID which have tradeoffs you might want to evaluate.
