<p>Peggle is fun! Definitely keep that one in the mix.</p>
<p><em>Dorfromantik</em> might be interesting to experiment with. It's slower paced but still easy to pick up and hand off to other people. <em>A Little to the Left</em> is a bit more challenging but it's a similar puzzle game that might also be interesting.</p>
