I think the official rules if you do this is that you can't get another extension. I don't know how they will handle it in reality but an "emergency extension" has different rules from the normal "sponsor visa extension" which the visa agencies offer. 30 days is all you get and you HAVE to leave but since the border might be closed still I'm not sure what they will do
