<p>If someone is interested in collaborating on an open-source project I'm looking for someone with statistical regression / bayesian optimization / machine learning expertise.</p>
<p>The project is a CLI tool and the goal would be to bring opt-in, lightweight ML with an Unix tool interface. Ideally, models would be small (smaller than 100MiB, smaller than 10MiB even better), CPU-driven, and very portable (not requiring many dependencies). Sound interesting?</p>
<p>Here is the project <a href="https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/library/">https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/library/</a></p>
<p>Some ideas that I have to get started:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improving clustering line similarity with more options. Existing code here: <a href="https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/library/blob/main/xklb/scripts/cluster_sort.py">https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/library/blob/main/xklb/scripts/cluster_sort.py</a></li>
<li>Image clustering, Im2txt?, etc</li>
<li>Automatic photo essay generator (dominant color clustering x feature clustering, there are a lot of different interesting options to explore here)</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_information_retrieval">Music information retrieval</a></li>
</ul>
