<p>Fantastic in-depth article! Thanks for sharing.</p>
<p>Recently I found it funny that <code>len('…'.encode()) == len('...'.encode())</code>. The first one is ellipses, the second are three dots.</p>
<p>This is obvious but for those that don't know if you encode a string to bytes then it should have the same number across all languages.</p>
<p>ie. Python will say <code>len('🤦🏼‍♂️'.encode()) == 17</code></p>
