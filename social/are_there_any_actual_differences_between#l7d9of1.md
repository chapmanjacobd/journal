The thing about many of the weird codecs is that multichannel might not exactly correspond with the same abstraction as "multi-track" audio:

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambisonics#Compatibility_with_existing_distribution_channels

Even though the different formats are lossless, converting between some of them might not be a "lossless" process

But I'm assuming that you are mostly talking about making backups of media that came on a DVD or BluRay. In that case, I think the main reason is media player compatibility and preserving media "as-is" for some notion of "highest quality available".
