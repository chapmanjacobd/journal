<p>I came across this really cool site via <a href="https://newart.city/show/eat-me">eat me, by Alice Yuan Zhang</a>. The format is imperfect but really neat!</p>
<p><a href="https://newart.city/show/specter">SPECTER, by kevin cunanan chappelle</a> for example, has a bunch of rotating things and it is hard to read the text if you only hover over things instead of clicking. At first, it seems like a jumbled mess but I think that plays well into the idea of memories, emotions, and reminiscing the past.</p>
<p><a href="https://newart.city/show/delta-ark">Where We Go From Here, by Delta_Ark</a> feels a lot more like the Metaverse than any virtual reality headset ever did.</p>
<p>There's a lot more. Highly recommend this site</p>
