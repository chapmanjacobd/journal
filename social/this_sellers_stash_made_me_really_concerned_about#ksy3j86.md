You have very valid points except maybe this:

> Most if not all these days are rated to a shock value of 250G or higher. That' WAY more than you think.

You can reach 350 Gs by dropping the drive from desk height onto a solid, un-squishy floor (concrete, tile, probably wood). If you have carpet you can probably get away with a few extra feet.

5 ft, would impact the ground at 5.46m/s (12.2mph). Assuming the impact is with a hard surface (d of acceleration is .001m), that would generate 1520 Gs
