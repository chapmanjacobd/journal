I collect interesting YouTube channels. 

If you have any that you recommend of any topic I'll check it out and add it to my database 

You can check out what I have so far like this:

    pip install xklb
    wget https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/lb/raw/main/examples/mealtime.tw.db
    library tubewatch mealtime.tw.db --sort random
