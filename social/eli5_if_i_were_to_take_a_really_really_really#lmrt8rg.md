Electricity is interesting because the electrons are moving pretty fast but it's not as fast as you might think. It takes hours to go from your light-switch to your lightbulb (drift velocity of about 1mm per second; 1,000 seconds to travel 1 meter) but when you turn on the light switch the light seems to turn on pretty much instantly. 

If you redefine your "push" to be using electrons then yes--as information waves electrons propagate at close to the speed of light--but it still wouldn't be "instant". It would still take years for the information to travel light-years
