After seeing Moonrise Kingdom I decided I really wanted to make a french film like Wes Anderson, amirite guys? So I got into film school.

AFI doesn't want me to share this tip with you, but I really want to help the community. In your camera settings change language to "fran√ßais" (named after Sir Francis Bacon). It lets you see through they eyes of Sir Francis Bacon and also Manray and all the other deceased Frenchmen.

Great trick imho.

post scriptum: Don't tell AFI I told you this.
