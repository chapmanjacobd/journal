I imagine it is largely because many ASMRtists don't see a connection between SFW ASMR and NSFW ASMR or they don't want to be seen that way. They are different genres, probably independently discovered: frisson, meditative intimacy, and mediated intimacy. But these different types of media learn from each other and so similar tropes are created in one and are reproduced in the other.

Also monetization is different for NSFW content. And if an existing ASMRtist wanted to start making NSFW content they risk alienating or embarrassing their existing fan base so their reputation could easily go down. 

If they try to skirt the community guidelines in YouTube for example, they risk getting their video marked as age-restricted and that affects not only that one video but it affects how their whole channel and all their other videos are ranked in the algorithm.

But there is certainly a lot of NSFW ASMR content. Especially in Japan. There's a 12TiB torrent out there with just Japanese NSFW & NSFW-adjacent ASMR audio files.
