<p>The truth is most digitally mixed music and even some live performances use auto-tune and retiming (fine-tuning drum hits for example) to correct small mistakes. But it's only done if you wouldn't be able to tell (if you notice it then it's a stylistic choice or a novice engineer) and often the small details like these things are without the explicit foreknowledge of the artist.</p>
