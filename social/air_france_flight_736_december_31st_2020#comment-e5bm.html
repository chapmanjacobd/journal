<p>Oh for sure, I also think Captain Joe and Admiral Cloudberg are a bit better from the technical perspective and I prefer that. Mentour's are likely more approachable for the average person. I haven't read/seen coverage on this flight from those or other sources and I liked that he focused on the group psychology aspect in this video.</p>
<p>I'm a big fan of aviation safety culture and wish more industries were as rigorous, preemptive, and holistic in making processes more efficient and safe. It's amazing to me that we have such in-depth and transparent retrospectives on largely "uneventful" accidents (no injuries).</p>
