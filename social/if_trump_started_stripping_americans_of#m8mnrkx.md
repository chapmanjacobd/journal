> The fact that they’ve already been given citizenship can’t be revoked, same as you can’t be found guilty of a non-crime you commit today if they outlaw it tomorrow.

This has actually happened before, in 1923:

> Not only were new applicants from India denied the privilege of naturalization, but the new racial classification suggested that the retroactive revocation of United States citizenship granted to Asian Indian Americans, of which there were many, might be supported by the Court's decision, a point that some courts upheld when United States attorneys petitioned to cancel the citizenship previously granted to many Asian Indian Americans. Up to fifty Indian Americans had their citizenship revoked between 1923 and 1927 as a consequence of the Thind ruling.
