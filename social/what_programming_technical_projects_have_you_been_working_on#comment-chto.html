<p>Over the past couple days I did some research into space-efficient modern codecs and I settled on</p>
<ul>
<li>AV1 <code>-c:v libsvtav1 -preset 8 -crf 44</code> for video</li>
<li>AVIF <code>2400px</code> for images</li>
<li>Opus <code>96k</code> for audio</li>
</ul>
<p>Pretty neat to see my phone camera folder go from 20GB to 2GB. Of course the quality difference is noticeable when comparing against the originals (except for Opus... I can't really tell) but for images and video the difference is small enough for me.</p>
