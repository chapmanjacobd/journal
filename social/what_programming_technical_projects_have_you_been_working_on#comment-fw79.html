<p>My brother-in-law is an indie filmmaker and he suggested I make a version of Disk Prices on eBay for digital cinema camera storage (ie. CFexpress, XQD, etc). So I'm starting work on that...</p>
<p>It's pretty straightforward but I keep getting distracted by other things like deciding how to use the <a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2025/Midea-Recalls-About-1-7-Million-U-and-U-Window-Air-Conditioners-Due-to-Risk-of-Mold-Exposure">Midea Air recall</a> refund: whether or not to upgrade my furnace with central air conditioning, install <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CTJDVB8K">a mini-split</a>, or just get <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0DXDVZXH2">1</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Midea-Conditioner-Ultra-Quiet-Operation-Energy-Saving/dp/B0FDQGPCG7">2</a> replacement window air conditioners... the main problem that I want to solve is that the main room of my house does not have any windows that would be suitable for a window air conditioner and the two rooms with the air conditioners do not mix with the cool air fast enough to provide meaningful coverage--even with a box fan pushing the cool air out into the main room.</p>
<p>Aside: Thermogeographically speaking, it probably makes more sense to push the hot air into the "return vent" rather than trying to move cold air but the "return vent" of a window air conditioner is a small target. A bit difficult to move air with <em>finesse</em> in this case. I'm not an air bender.</p>
<p>I currently have a Midea U 10K and an 8K. It seems like a lot of the outlets in my house share the same 20 A breaker. During the heat wave there were times when it tripped when both were on. Usually that doesn't happen and they can both be on. A single-zone mini-split might reduce the burden of the 2 window units a bit to prevent this from happening as I have a "free" 220v breaker in the box connected to baseboard heating which I don't use.</p>
<p>I got a quote for ~$5,500 USD to buy+install a mini-split. It would be <em>a lot</em> cheaper to do it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mKwCmaR5Qg">by myself</a> but I'm not 100% confident that all the wires exist where I would need them to be. They also quoted me ~$9,500 for a 1.5 ton Carrier furnace/air conditioner system+installation (I don't have space for a separate central AC system but my furnace is pretty old anyway) so I might just do that instead... or <a href="https://youtu.be/wwQXOo-fNFI">maybe install it myself</a></p>
<p>I'm also thinking of removing the through-the-wall air conditioner which doesn't work and has been sitting in the wall in the main room and turning it back into a normal wall. I'm also thinking about moving to St. Louis instead... but to sell the house I should probably do one or more of the above first.</p>
