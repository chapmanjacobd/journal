I bought a 2bedroom house for $30k in a small town a few hours from Chicago. Utilities and property taxes combined are about $200/mo (including gigabit internet). It's kind of boring here but it's nice not to have a lot of monthly expenses and it's a  friendly neighborhood

If covid ever goes away I might sell my house and go back to nomading
