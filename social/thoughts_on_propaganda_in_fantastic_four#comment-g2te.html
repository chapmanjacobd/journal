<p>Unfortunately, the term "ethnic discrimination" has not really caught on--at least in the US. But this mirrors US thinking where discrimination might start due to a deeper ethnic stereotype but then it spreads surface-level and skin-deep. Race might be overstated as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signified_and_signifier">signifier</a> of ethnicity but this quickly looses all meaning until it only signifies otherness. Thus racism is used in the US as an overloaded metonymy encompassing all forms of discrimination.</p>

<p>there are white, brown, black, asian, etc</p>

<p>The American focus on race is a bit shallow. If news channels focused a bit less on 1970s racial classification systems for the purpose of quickly explaining away people and more on showing and sharing ethnic cultural practices there might not be such a wide gap that separates people.</p>
