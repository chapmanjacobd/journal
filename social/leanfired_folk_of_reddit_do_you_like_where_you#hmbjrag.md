I do spatial analysis as a hobby so I estimated walkability of every town and checked which ones would be cheapest to live in because I think houses in the US are way overvalued (but it's hard to live somewhere outside the US right now).

I don't have a good interface for exploring this data but I created [something](https://unli.xyz/city/calc/) which might be useful. The UI is difficult to use because it's trying to be too many things at once. Maybe I'll get an idea for how to simplify the design some day ðŸ¤”

Yeah my neighbors don't say much but they are always waving "hi" if we see each other outside at the same time. but I kinda like it like that
