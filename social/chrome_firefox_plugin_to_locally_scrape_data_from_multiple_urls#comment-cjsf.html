<p>The website you linked to loads additional pages as HTML. I wrote something with seleniumwire that can do this if the data loads with JSON. It is a bit experimental and the results might be spread across a lot of different tables but it works.</p>
<pre><code>pip install xklb
lb siteadd output.db --scroll $URL

<p>xml.parsers.expat.ExpatError: not well-formed (invalid token): line 19, column 24</p>

<p>which I'm not very surprised by. HTML is difficult for programs to parse. I'm sure it might work for <em>some</em> websites but certainly not the German phonebook site.</p>
