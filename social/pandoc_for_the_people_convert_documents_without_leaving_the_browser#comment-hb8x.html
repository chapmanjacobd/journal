<p>Pandoc claims to be a universal document converter--and it is pretty great for XML, LaTeX, and a few obscure formats--but I've found that it doesn't quite come close to being an "ffmpeg" of text document/book formats. Even Calibre's <code>ebook-convert</code> is better at bidirectional conversion support.</p>
<p>Still, it is pretty neat that this all runs in the browser! I'll have to remember that this exists</p>
