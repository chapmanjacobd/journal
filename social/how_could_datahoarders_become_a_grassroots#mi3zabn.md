The long-tail of media is always endangered given that there are bandwidth and storage constraints in every archival system. The NSA bypassed this problem by focusing on metadata.

Random sampling of the internet firehose is not a terrible strategy but if you can ignore popular topics and wade into the long-tail then you'll have a better chance of getting something that few people have copies of.

Torrent sites make this strategy salient by letting you filter and sort on number of seeds. Seeding things that have few seeders helps to increase resilience and accessibility.

> precious data, on the brink of being deleted from our collective memory

If something is truly rare I would argue that it is more likely to be a fabricated reality rather than something representative of the actual lived experience of humans. If something is a collective memory then there will naturally be many copies of it--the exception here is data that is held behind walls. For example, DRM and/or online streaming platforms. Data of endangered peoples are also at risk because there are fewer people that can "carry the torch".
