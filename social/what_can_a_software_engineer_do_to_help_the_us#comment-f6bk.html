<p>One of the reasons we are in this mess is that our social media is a mess: echo chambers, authoritarian platforms, purchase-able influence. Some of these problems could be solved by applying or mis-applying research in novel ways. I think you'd want to <del>increase interactions between different users</del>, discourage the formation of large hubs but encourage small hubs to form between users.</p>

<p>Fixing the social media problem is difficult for a single person to do; especially without government intervention if only due to the network effect and that regimes that have paid into the system don't want people leaving it for something else.</p>
<p>You could make something that combines ideas from Tildes and ideas from craigslist... something that is like meetup.com but only for local events and doesn't require user accounts. Maybe combine ActivityPub and Google Calendar in a novel way that's super accessible.</p>
<p>maybe this already exists:</p>

<p>You could <a href="https://join.doge.gov/">sign up to work for Musk</a>--not even as a "double" agent but just as a person with some personal integrity--it could be impactful. But this seems kinda stressful and potentially dangerous.</p>
