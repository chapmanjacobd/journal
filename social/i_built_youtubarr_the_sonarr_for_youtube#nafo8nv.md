> as that can be "risky"

I've never had problems scraping metadata even while being blocked from YouTube downloading. I don't think Google cares that much about the metadata compared to downloading videos nonstop.

In any case you can always access the metadata without cookies and yt-dlp _can_ be used on the RSS feed instead with `--force-generic-extractor`
