<p>I've done this. The purchase experience of my DIY mattress was not that complicated. The main downside was waiting for delivery and unpacking everything. After everything is decompressed and aired out it takes less time to put together than it takes to make a bed. It's a giant sandwich.</p>
<h2>Why I went DIY</h2>
<p>My main reason for doing so was because I usually buy stuff online. Shopping for ready-made mattresses seemed confusing because there were too many options but they never really differentiated offerings in terms of technical aspects. It seemed mostly about who could spend the most marketing money and it is difficult to know what you are really getting. Mattress stores solve this problem but this was during covid times and I was feeling socially anxious so I never actually checked whether any mattress stores were open...</p>
<h2>What did I get?</h2>
<p>Everyone has different tastes and despite being relatively young (I'm in my late 20s) I have slept on probably more than 80 beds in the past ten years and I know from experience that I don't like memory foam or water beds. One makes me too hot and one makes me too cold. From spending ~30 mins reading in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Mattress/">/r/Mattress</a>/ it seemed like latex was the ideal material for me. I ordered from <a href="https://latexmattressfactory.com/">Latex Mattress Factory</a> because it had the best deals/reviews at the time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dunlop Latex 2" Mattress Topper Soft (19 ILD)</li>
<li>Dunlop Latex 2" Mattress Topper Medium (28 ILD)</li>
<li>QuantumÂ® 8" Edge Elite Pocketed Coil</li>
<li>Natural Quilted Cover</li>
<li>Adjustable bed base</li>
<li>Bamboo bed sheets</li>
</ul>
<p>In total it was $734. If I were to do it again I wouldn't spend $223 on the Quilted Cover. That was way overkill. I'm sure there are cheaper options for that. I should note that this is only a Twin XL as my plan was/is to get another Twin XL and then merge them into one mega-bed after my wife gets her visa approved in the next 1-2 years.</p>
<p>Would I do it again? Yes. It is the definition of comfort and not just due to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IKEA_effect">IKEA effect</a>. I can really tell the difference between latex mattresses and other mattresses.</p>
<p>DIY is about customization but I think it only makes sense for certain types of mattress materials. I've had this mattress for about two years and I haven't felt the urge to adjust anything about it. In the US mattresses must comply with federal mattress flammability standards. I wouldn't have done DIY mattress if I preferred fiberglass mattresses or something like that. If you prefer hard beds you could DIY a bamboo bed/mattress pretty easily too and depending where you live that might only a few hours of labor and some kind donations from a neighbor.</p>
<p>But especially the adjustable bed part. It's a game changer. Acid reflux? Just make the whole bed slightly tilted. Stomach ache / back ache? Turn on vibrate mode. Doesn't always make me feel better but it works surprisingly well when it does. It's the definition of convenience.</p>
