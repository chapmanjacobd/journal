<p>I switched from Xfinity Now back to Xfinity to lock in the $55/mo price for 5 years for 400Mbps (and 1 year of Xfinity Mobile free) and one hiccup that I wasn't expecting was that routing the coaxial through my CyberPower CP1500AVRLCD UPS was causing signal issues so it wouldn't activate (the light on the XB6 would stay blinking green instead of blinking white) so I had to connect it without the UPS intermediary. I guess that is what happens when you buy refurbished UPS at steep discounts... (I think it was around $50)</p>
<p>On that note I'm miffed that the house across the street has gigabit fiber for about the same price as what I'm paying... It's been like that for about five years. guess I'll join the army...</p>
