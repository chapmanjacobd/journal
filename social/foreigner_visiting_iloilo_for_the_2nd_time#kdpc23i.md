Miagao and San Jose, Antique are also worth a visit. Lots of good food around there (Talabahans, etc).

This might sound weird but definitely take advantage of the prices for stuff like facial spa (ie. BEAUTY Essentials on Solis street). After a few days in iloilo my face always feels kinda dirty from the idling jeepneys but it really feels better and cleaner after going to the spa. Don't underestimate the power of skin care.

- SM City is a nice place to shop and chill
- Roberto's has nice King siopao but they've gone downhill a bit
- Don't sleep on malunggay pandesal

Aside from all that definitely visit Mang Inasal of course...
