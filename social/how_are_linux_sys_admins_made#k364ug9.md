I don't usually endorse certifications but I think something standardized like this is the right way to be introduced to operating systems. 

And then to _be_ comfortable at the terminal you need to _make_ it comfortable. Make it a home. If you use Linux as a daily driver it will help you remember things and you will naturally learn new things every day.

The alternative to this is to just install Linux and start reading man pages https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ltrace.1.html 

but there are about 8,000 man pages
