you lack imagination. the progress we've made since the first non-CRT monitors is amazing but there is still more that can be done. Yeah you're right about missing colors because we'd be relying on ambient light but maybe we could also combine the two techniques and use a mixture of ambient and direct light. Some mix of ambient light rejecting and accepting. maybe impossible to think about today but I think there is a lot of possibility in this space. Mass-producibility and funding are real constraints tho
