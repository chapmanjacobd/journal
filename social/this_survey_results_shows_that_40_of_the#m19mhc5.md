Also, a lot of internet content is deleted or lost over time but LLMs often have this deleted data in their training data so at times it might produce something that seems useful and novel but actually it is just from a StackOverflow post that was deleted 3 years ago. That phenomena along with search engine quality going down as companies choose to push more and more ads... it's not surprising to me that people are impressed with LLMs when their baseline for information is an SEO-stuffed Quora clone that tries to sell them seen-on-TV products every 15 seconds
