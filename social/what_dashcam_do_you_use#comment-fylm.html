<p>I don't have a specific device to recommend but I suggest buying quality cards for recording.</p>
<p>Instead of getting a card that is marketed for its fast write speed like SanDisk Ultra, buy the cards that are marketed for endurance like SanDisk High Endurance, Samsung Pro Endurance, or Samsung EVO Plus (sold as EVO Select on Amazon). People have reported to have trouble accessing recordings made on lower quality cards (and even the fast, expensive cards which don't have specific longevity guarantees).</p>
<p>I bought an expensive dashcam a few years ago but after coming back from a long trip it stopped powering on completely. I guess the sun melted it inside. Six months ago I replaced that with a cheap dashcam from taobao and it's been perfectly fine (but it only speaks Chinese (like the sound effects when turning on) even when the UI is in English)</p>
