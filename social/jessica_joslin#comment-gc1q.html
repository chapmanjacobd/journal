<p>If my personal endorsement / context is demanded: the artwork on this page reminds me of those <em>I Spy</em> children books where there are a lot of curious objects on the page. I don't often see playful sculpture quite like <a href="https://www.jessicajoslin.com/commissions?pgid=m97q6o30-c3b31e07-f06c-47f0-a680-dfa7b4c0a3c7">monkey on a ball</a>, <a href="https://www.jessicajoslin.com/commissions?pgid=m97q6o30-8224d430-7c3a-462b-86fd-31e1a62fc033">dog on a bike</a>. Maybe it used to be more common? Like... are these rich children's toys? Those are the questions that go through my mind when looking at these</p>
