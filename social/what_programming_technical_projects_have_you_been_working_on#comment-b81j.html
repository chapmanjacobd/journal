<p>I've been working off and on this week on a CLI tool that opens a browser and saves arbitrary table-like data (including any JSON responses) that it sees into a SQLITE database so that I can easily filter through jobs based on my own where clause across multiple job sites.</p>
<p>I can convert arbitrary JSON to 3NF relational tables just fine. The problem right now is figuring out what the different tables should be named :/</p>
