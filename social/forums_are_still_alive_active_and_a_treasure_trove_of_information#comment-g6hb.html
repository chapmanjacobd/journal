<p>The <a href="https://www.quicksandfans.com/">quicksand</a> one... I did not expect that. I guess it is really a thing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"... I enjoy sinking myself. I've gone out sinking multiple times, both alone and with past girlfriends ..."</p>
<p>So, how does one go 'sinking'?</p>
<p>"It involves a lot of bushwacking. You can go to almost any nature preserve and find mud inches deep, but to find workable stuff you have to do a lot of hiking through trees, through tall grass. The best spot I've ever visited personally was ... near a stream, a brook fed into a larger pond and deposited silt and dirt as it flowed into the pond. It was a massive patch of almost literally bottomless mud."</p>
<p>And once you do find a nice, moist hole to slip into?</p>
<p>"For the most part it's me alone. It's difficult to describe. It's really just the act of getting in, the feel of it, for me personally I like the feel of it and the taboo aspect. Modern civilized people look at mud and getting dirty and go 'ooh that's not for me' ... so knowing I'm doing something that's not wrong, but frowned upon ... it's a rush."</p>
<p>Carl added, "I have gone with ex-girlfriends before," as well as one male friend. But, "If I'm going sinking with my male friend that's into it, it's nothing sexual at all. He's got his reasons, I've got mine."</p>
