<p>Yes, I forget where I read/heard it. I think it was a report from an acquaintance of Kronos that you can read in his bedroom after breaking in through the roof of his car. Or maybe a newspaper clipping that you can read in one of the compartments. It was implied that someone killed his friend and the police were asking for him because they saw them together.</p>
<p>HOWEVER, I definitely felt like you felt (and I still do feel). The impression that people get that the protagonist is flawed TOTALLY outweighs a small newspaper clipping that 3% of players might accidentally read--it may as well not exist. I think the point is that it is a mystery: you're finding out <em>who you are</em> as you play... but some of the character dialog is really... out there. In this way it is much less like an RPG... it is more like reading a book.</p>
