I'm not sure. You might have to make your own layout

I'm a fan of mod-dh but tbh learning a new layout won't change your life significantly. The physical ergonomics of the keyboard is number one for helping your wrists not hurt. Better to invest that time into learning a new language like Mandarin or F#

But maybe colemak will help. I would stick with colemak over workman if your preference is comfort. I wouldn't move t from the home row unless the language that you type the most isn't English
