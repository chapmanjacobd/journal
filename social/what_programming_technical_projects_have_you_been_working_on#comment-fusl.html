<p>I empathize. I feel this. Sometimes a lot. It's a great feeling when tools that we write work <em>100% of the time</em>! But there are a couple tools that I rely on frequently (which I wrote for myself) which are nefarious and vexing. It's easy to blame the software that it interacts with--ie. Firefox's caching sometimes empties out what I'd rather keep permanently in Local Storage... Software which talks incrementally over the network is also difficult to write correctly... But sometimes the simplest of programs can vex you when all troubleshooting yields that the program is correct but your feeling of what the output should be does not quite match what the output is...</p>
