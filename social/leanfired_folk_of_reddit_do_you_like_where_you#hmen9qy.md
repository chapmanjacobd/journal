Look for properties in Illinois. There are a lot of "good deals" but imho I think they are still overvalued even at $30k. My house was move-in ready and it was on the market for almost a year. the owner was still alive but getting old. he and his wife live in a town about an hour away. That being said the house is about 100 years old and its under 1000 sqft. 

I probably should've replaced the carpet in one of the rooms before I moved in but it's not totally gross either and I'm lazy. They left all their appliances too even washer and dryer and a new water heater so I feel like I got a pretty good deal but there are similar houses on the market nearby--they just need a bit of renovation.

I don't have a lot of real estate data but there are definitely towns where it's cheaper to rent and towns where it's much cheaper to buy.

maybe people around here don't have extra cash to put a downpayment on a home. or they know they want to move away from Illinois once they graduate University so they aren't willing to buy a house here.

some people complain about Illinois's high property tax but if it's your own house you get a discount on that

mobile homes are way overpriced even here
