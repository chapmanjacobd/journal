<p>If you're having trouble with NFS in terms of reliability, try comparing the speed with SSHFS or even rsync. Maybe you don't really need NFS</p>
<p>I combine plocate and sftp/scp/rsync to search across many computers and it works well. I use it multiple times per day:</p>

<p>SSHFS is also fast enough once you figure out the right config (setting max_conn to something between 8 and 40 is really important! essentially, how many files you expect to access at the same time--but don't set it to something ridiculous like 400 either--I imagine the overhead can get big)</p>
