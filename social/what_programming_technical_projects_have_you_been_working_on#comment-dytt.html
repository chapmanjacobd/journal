<p>I've futzed with WireGuard for a few hours a couple years ago but wasn't able to get it to do what I wanted. I think the main problem was that I didn't have IP forwarding enabled and firewalld was also blocking me but I didn't know that back then.</p>
<p>Recently, I tried <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1017/install">tailscale</a> and it's been pretty great! Not bad for a free service... their revenue play seems to be similar to CloudFlare so I'm not too worried about relying on it--in the worst case, I could swap out the server with <a href="https://headscale.net/setup/requirements/">Headscale</a> which is a bit more setup but seems like a good alternative.</p>
<p>Now that my computers are setup as exit nodes it's very easy to "VPN" via computers that I own (faster and more reliable than OpenVPN, etc). I've started using Fedora IoT which is the <a href="https://ostreedev.github.io/ostree/introduction/">atomic</a> version of Fedora Server. It comes with <a href="https://github.com/fedora-iot/greenboot/">greenboot</a> which will automatically rollback any updates that bring down services (like the tailscale client daemon). Overall, it's been fun to use. I'm pretty impressed with it and I'm more confident in auto-updates now.</p>
