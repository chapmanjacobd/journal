Mmm yeah there are still lots of stories about seasons in places with less than 4 seasons. In fact, I think the idea of FOUR seasons is pretty modern. For the northern hemispheres there is Winter and Summer but the other two seasons are simply transitory states between those two seasons.

In the Pacific, most myth and folklore contains some element of time passing usually the passing of the sun from day to night or crop cycles.

The distinction between wet and dry seasons may seem subtle to people who experience extremes (like Sakha people), but the difference is significant and easily recognizable once you adapt to the environment / count the number of days between rainfall (something you might do if you were growing taro, etc).

If there are truly temperate places in the world then those places are probably too small to contain a single culture. I think the passing of time from year to year is pretty significant for the development of certain stories. I see culture as the summarization of a local history. If there is not much that changes in the weather then the passing of time is probably written in a way that emphasizes the passing of genealogy

Edit: there is an index of mythology constructed on index cards by some guy in his home in California sometime during the 1930-1980s. I'm struggling to remember the title but I think you'd find what you are looking for if you just look for an mythology index somewhere
