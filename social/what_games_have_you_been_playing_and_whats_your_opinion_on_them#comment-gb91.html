<p>While looking through Ron Gilbert's ouvre I came across <em>Maniac Mansion</em>. I have played <em>Day of the Tentacle</em> before, a long time ago; totally oblivious that it is a sequel to <em>Maniac Mansion</em>. Yesterday was the first day I sat down and watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7oUArcVis0">a playthrough</a>.</p>
<p>I'm impressed! It's a really funny game. Apparently it is also the first use of cutscenes in a game <em>or rather Ron Gilbert invented the word "cutscenes"</em> during game development. The way the cutscenes work is very jarring too! Instead of playing when characters exit or enter a room it just totally interrupts whatever you were in the middle of and plays a scene far away.</p>
<p>So probably we are all using the word cutscenes wrong because there were non-interactive narrative sequences in video games before <em>Maniac Mansion</em> but not abrupt ones where you need to invent a new word to convince people that it is intentional...</p>
