you can use Termux and Tasker together via the [termux-tasker](https://github.com/termux/termux-tasker/releases) plugin. I use this to play music automatically when starting my car and the car's bluetooth becomes active on my phone.

You can also use [crontab](https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/phone/blob/main/.config/fish/functions/crontab.fish) in Termux. I use this as my alarm clock: play music on my chromecast speaker groups when I'm at home to wake me up; and play relaxing music when it is time for bed--when I'm not at home don't do anything.

Here is my [setup script](https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/phone/blob/main/setup.sh)
