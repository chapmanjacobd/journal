as long as the charger supports both the Voltage and Amperage which the Pulse 14 wants then it should work. This is the whole point of USB

you can't rely on wattage (60W or 100W) but if a charger supports (eg. 20V/4.5A) and that is what your laptop wants then it should work !

if it doesn't work then that means that something is fundamentally wrong with the USB C negotiation firmware and I wouldn't trust plug anything in it! most likely this isn't the case so you will be fine

it looks like the Pulse 14 wants 20V/4.5A

Note also that while you will be required to use 20V your charger can supply 5A or even more but the laptop will only "pull" 4.5A. This means you could get a 20V/5A (or 6A or 8A but most likely they don't exist)
