<p>Oh weird! I can definitely replicate this in my browser. Fedora 41; Firefox and Chromium too. Scrolls down normally but scrolling up while selecting makes it go really fast.</p>
<p>Hmm... I played around with the CSS and layout for a bit and couldn't find anything interesting. Firefox starts scrolling 200px below the top of the viewport. Compared to other sites which start at 0px... it is unexpected. But if you pretend the top is 200px lower then you can slowly select text and it will move slowly :)</p>
<p>maybe file a bug with Wikipedia</p>
<p>Otherwise, I suggest you get rid of this awful habit! lol (I used to do the same) maybe replace it with turning the mouse into a big <a href="https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/computer/blob/main/bin/wheel.py">PgUp/PgDown simulator</a>...</p>
