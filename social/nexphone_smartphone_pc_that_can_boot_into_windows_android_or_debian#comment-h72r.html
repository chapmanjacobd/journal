<p>And why does the MicroSD expansion only allow access to 512GB?</p>

<p>Honestly, I think this might be a mistake on their marketing. The phone obviously supports SDXC so it should be able to read/write up to 2TB capacity microSD cards. I'm not sure why phone manufacturers don't state it like this?!</p>
<p>If a phone can support at least 64GB then it should be able to support 2TB. The SD specification exists for a reason.</p>
