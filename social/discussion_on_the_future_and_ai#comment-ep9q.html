<p>The basic architecture is mostly about streaming weights and inputs through an array of mostly identical operations. The volumes are huge, but not much magical is happening down there. So the moats are very thin in reality.</p>

<p>I agree with this sentiment and you've condensed the core of the idea nicely. Well said.</p>
<p>However, human brains, computers, AI (even AGI) are all similar systems when you get down to the information-theoretic details. There is input and output. Any output which matches the input is perhaps the most useful. Duplication preserves the status quo. Any expansion of data is only useful when it creates novel meaning via mutation. Any compression of data is desirable until the point of unintelligibility. A lot of data is garbage. Including the kind of data that organizations base important decisions on. AI doesn't really change that much.</p>
<p>I see the social system, the economic system, basic human needs... all of these things have largely become incommensurable and completely independent of each other. Maslow's hierarchy of needs no longer build like blocks on a pyramid. Like forgotten soviet tools we abandon certain modes of thinking and living in exchange for <em>the new</em>. I agree that there isn't much to LLMs but it is certainly a different phenomenon from the blockchain or cryptocurrency hype--whole new <em>classes</em> of tools are possible. As a human species, we are crafting a new <em>mode of being</em> regardless of whether we can control or be controlled by an eventual AGI.</p>
