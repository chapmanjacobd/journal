<p>I've been working on building a GUI for selective Syncthing downloading. I like the plugins system that Filestash provides so I've been building on top of that. The <a href="https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/filestash/blob/59d39be8d540f13c9b92e6836b29412c2eb90984/server/plugin/plg_backend_syncweb/index.go">core functionality</a> is mostly there but the UI needs some adjustment...</p>
<p>The way to override default code <a href="https://github.com/mickael-kerjean/filestash/blob/master/server/plugin/plg_override_actiondelete/assets/pages/filespage/thing.js">via patches</a> is really interesting but because it's a compiled program I think I'll just keep track of changes inside git commits instead.</p>
<p>Here are some other interesting repos that I found but didn't end up using:</p>

</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>WFM begun its life around 1994 as a Perl CGI script for CERN httpd server. It was developed to allow uploading logs, traces, dumps and other case data by support engineers and customers. Later rewritten in C language, when CGIC library and Apache httpd were released. Up until 2015, it has been a closed source commercial application used for lightweight document management and supported by a few customers. It has now been open sourced. In 2022 WFM has been rewritten in Go as a stand-alone application with a built-in web server for modern deployment scenarios.</p>
