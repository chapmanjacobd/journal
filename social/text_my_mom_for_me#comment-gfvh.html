<p>oh I found some more information about the intent of the site</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I thought it would be funny if people could text my mom right from my website, so I made an little web app for it. To build this, I taught myself Node, Express, MongoDB and some light form verification to make sure people could only send her emojis. [ Note: now just a static page- the gmail api I was using got removed, so you can't text her anymore :( ]</p>

<p>and also the <a href="https://github.com/radio-alice/text-mom">source code</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm a busy guy. Between writing my thesis, taking enough classes to graduate, making the best art on the net, and figuring out how to save the world from impending apocalypse, I've got a lot on my plate. Sometimes I don't have time to text my mom, so I need YOU to help me out. Pick out some emojis that convey my filial love and fire away.</p>
