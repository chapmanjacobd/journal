I don't think door-to-door is realistic at all but many HK malls (especially ones right next to residential estates) frequently have popup stalls. At least twice per month but some malls have them three or four times per week. I imagine the fee to participate is not that high because I often see the same people there over and over and they don't seem to have many sales.

If your concept is proven HKTVmall might be a good next step: https://cloud.marketing.hktvmall.com/applymerchant_FAQeng
