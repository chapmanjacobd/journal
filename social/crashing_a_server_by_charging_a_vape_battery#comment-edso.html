<p>Bear.Rootz sounds like a rootkit lol...</p>
<p>I have a really long &gt;15m USB cable and the past couple days it has been pretty flaky but I don't get any of the issues you mentioned. I can still SSH in and run dmesg:</p>

<p>When I run this usb_reset script then everything works again for another 10 minutes:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

if [[ $EUID != 0 ]] ; then
  echo This must be run as root!
  exit 1
fi

for xhci in /sys/bus/pci/drivers/?hci_hcd ; do

  if ! cd $xhci ; then
    echo Weird error. Failed to change directory to $xhci
    exit 1
  fi

  echo Resetting devices from $xhci...

  for i in ????:??:??.? ; do
    echo -n "$i" &gt; unbind
    echo -n "$i" &gt; bind
  done
done
</code></pre>
<p>But it sounds like your USB issues are lower level... probably interrupt or power!? related</p>

<p>None of those will likely help solve your problem but they were interesting to read</p>
