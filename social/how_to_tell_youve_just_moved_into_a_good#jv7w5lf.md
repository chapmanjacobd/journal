Initially I interpreted it as afterlife but after reading your comment:

If the person who wrote this is trying to say, "the (new) people who have adapted to the current system, are living lives endemically incapable of experiencing love" it would be much clearer and simpler to say "True love is impossible for the new people"

Instead I think it might mean "True love is possible for the people in the next world (which we can help to create), but it is too late for us"
