I have the same case and I used this: [Phanteks - Stackable 3.5" HDD Bracket Duo Pack Cases PH-HDDKT_03](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GY2B3WP). 

There might be a better one but it fits and it works _okay_. The fit of each drive to the bracket is a bit tight. It doesn't really connect well to the Antek case but it's not like you're moving the PC every day, right? If you need something that can survive an earthquake this ain't it but for $10... idk. It works ok
