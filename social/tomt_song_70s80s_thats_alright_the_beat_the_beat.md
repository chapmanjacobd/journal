This could be a remix or a mashup of two different songs, but I am pretty sure it was made in the 70-80's.

The lyrics I remember are as follows:

...

That's Allllrrrriiiiigggghhht [woman's voice]
the beat, the beat, the beat is bad [man's voice]

...

If (youwannadoabout??)
I think we should talk about it
(cuz that's the way it is??)
It's alright... [woman's voice]

EDIT:
It seems to be a remix using this song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8G2x3ibDl8
