The impact of 4:2:2 is way overstated. Luma is more important than Chroma but 10 bit color does make quite a difference. If both options are 10 bit color they are pretty much the same. If anything 4:2:0 is better because it means you are making the most of the 150Mbps bitrate

HEVC is about 30% to 50% more efficient than AVC so at the same bitrate you're keeping a lot more information. Or rather you're discarding less noise. Not noise in the SNR sense but more of an information theory sense.

edit: removed 8-bit uncertainty
