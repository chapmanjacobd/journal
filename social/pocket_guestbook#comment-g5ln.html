<p>An ESP8266-based web server that hosts an offline guestbook from an SD card. This was an experiment to create interactive web application on an embedded system with minimal “server-side” data processing.</p>
<p>The device hosts an access point and acts as a captive portal to redirect all connected clients to the guestbook page. The hardware is a WeMos D1 Mini clone with a micro to full-size SD card adapter soldered directly to it. AP settings, static web files, and persisted guest entries are all stored on the SD card.</p>
