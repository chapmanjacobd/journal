<p>Price wars are a good case study for this dilemma.</p>
<p>If a company has increased profit by taking market share via temporarily reduced prices, it's not immediately clear whether their choices have led to increased or decreased short term or long term profits, but it is clear that their actions have a net negative effect on the country's economy.</p>
<p>Less profit within the industry means reduced investment which leads to less money for R&amp;D; less innovation leads to less economic growth. Short-term belt tightening can be good... it can encourage people to think creatively and differentiate their product. But long-term it causes competitors to close: reducing competition.</p>
<p>The drive for profit nearly always leads to consolidation: oligopolies and monopolies. Monopolies can be generative, especially in the short-term, but long-term they eventually turn parasitic. That's not to say that governments are exempt from this, <em>per se</em>. Governments can be just as parasitic as large non-governmental organizations.</p>
<p>If a government operates a monopoly, and if the government has the same incentives and moral structures as these corporations, then it can certainly behave like a corporation. The difference between large organizations and governments is often only one of <em>true goals</em> and accountability. Identifying and auditing that your governments goals are the same that are claimed is made easier by laws of transparency.</p>

<p>Global mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) volume has tripled over the past two decades, reaching over $3.6 trillion in 2021 alone. This surge in M&amp;A activity has been driven by the ready availability of cheap debt, which has allowed companies to finance acquisitions at historically low costs. The acquisition of YouTube by Google in 2006, long before the platform became profitable, is a prime example of how large tech companies have used this strategy to eliminate competition and entrench their market positions.</p>

<p>If we define economic growth as accounting for this, if the goal is long-term sustainability (even sustainable de-growth when necessary: small businesses laying off people several times per year is less disruptive than coordinated annual corporate decimation), it can no longer be called simply capitalism.</p>
