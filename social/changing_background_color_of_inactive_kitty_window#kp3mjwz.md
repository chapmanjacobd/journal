I'm not sure of a way to do this. You may need to open a feature request.

On KDE I use the "Dim Inactive" desktop effect with a relatively high strength of 25. This makes it very obvious when windows are backgrounded (even though I use only one active window >90% of the time and alt-tab or Meta+number keys). You may be able to find something similar in the Desktop Environment that you use.
