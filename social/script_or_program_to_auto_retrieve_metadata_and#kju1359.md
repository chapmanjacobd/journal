When I used Windows I really liked [therenamer](http://www.therenamer.com/) but it's been a long time since I've used that--not sure how well it has held up. I've heard good things about Filebot. 

I use [mnamer](https://github.com/jkwill87/mnamer) though I don't use this often because I don't really care about renaming files unless they are playing out of order. 

About ten years ago I tried [EMDB: Eric's Movie DataBase](https://www.emdb.eu/) and I thought it was really cool. I guess people mostly use Plex and Plex-adjacent tools nowadays.

I also have my own software which handles _a bunch_ of different tasks. Any time I need to automate something more than a few times I add the script into here: https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/library
