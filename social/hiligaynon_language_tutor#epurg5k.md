probably the best way will be to learn it there... pm me your email and I have a pretty good pdf guide. most of the other resources online are out of date. Hiligaynon changes quickly and there is new slang every year

edit: many people have messaged me so I'm just going to stick a link to it here: 

ah I just looked it up and I guess the author put it [on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Giant-Ilonggo-Phrasebook-Paul-Soderquist/dp/1387223747) so you should probably buy a copy there
