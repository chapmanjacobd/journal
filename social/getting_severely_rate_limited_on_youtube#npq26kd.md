I don't think a VPN is necessary. 

If you do have access to multiple IP addresses then you could use something like https://github.com/targetdisk/squid-dl but for downloading a couple thousand videos it's super overkill. If you're fine with 1 video at a time (and YouTube's speeds are very fast) then 1 IP address is all you need imho.
