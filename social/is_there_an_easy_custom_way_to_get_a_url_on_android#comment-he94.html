<p>Firefox for Android can send links between my logged in devices and I frequently use it in combination with my site to send 50 or 100 URLs to my PC in a few clicks</p>

<p>Or send the links to yourself via Email?</p>
<p>Recently, it's also been useful for me to SSH in to my computer from my phone or vice verse and update the remote clipboard by doing <code>cat | xsel --clipboard --input</code> or <code>cat | termux-clipboard-set</code>, pasting in stuff, press Ctrl-D and then it's on the remote clipboard</p>
