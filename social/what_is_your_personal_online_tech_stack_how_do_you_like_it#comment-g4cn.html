<p>One of the big reasons is that videos are taken down: channels are deleted. On reddit, about half of the videos no longer exist. On hackernews, about 30%. Sure, some of them are spam, but with over 7 upvotes that is not very likely.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I regret downloading over 1TiB of TNG Warp Core sounds. Thanks whoever uploaded a full channel of the same sound... Still, this was relatively easy to discover and delete.</p>
<p>The other motivating factor is because I want to "escape the [YouTube] algorithm". Having everything locally means that you can easily filter/play 50 videos with a specific duration, or other metadata that YouTube doesn't make searchable, and limit the distractions (to not see other channels that you don't trust). Some of this can be fixed with BlockTube but having full control of how videos are <a href="https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/library?tab=readme-ov-file#regex-sort">sorted</a> is a big motivating factor for me.</p>
<p>Finally, there is this hacker notion of <strong>broadcatching</strong> which is very attractive to me. Like, having your own Library of Alexandria. You're no longer just a user; you're the architect of your own information universe. To capture and own just a little bit of the long tail: the high-pressure fire hose of data.</p>
