<p>I've been involved in a banking modernization project and there's nothing really special about COBOL except for years of momentum. There's some hardware shortcuts that specialized mainframes can offer but embarrassingly parallel commodity hardware can easily outperform any realistic batch-processing problem dollar-for-dollar.</p>
<p>But also there is no substantial "problem" with using an <em>industry-adopted</em> language (eg. COBOL or Ada) over something more popular across industries. These programmers have years of industry experience and are often quite good at knowing the value that they bring to the table. Management wants flexibility and interchangeable humans to drive the cost of labor down. But the entrenched systems are winning. COBOL is going to stay around for a few more decades at least.</p>
<p>Banks have spent probably <em>double</em> the amount in savings that they could have had if any of the modernization projects over the years were ever successful--most fail. They are usually just trading one locked-in vendor for another more modern but less customized system.</p>
