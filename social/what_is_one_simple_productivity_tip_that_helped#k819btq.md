Remap shortcuts to be intuitive. For example, I got used to Kitty shortcuts so I spent a couple hours making tmux behave in similar ways. Now I don't have to second-guess my intuition:

- [tmux.conf](https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/computer/blob/main/.config/tmux/tmux.conf)
- [kitty.conf](https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/computer/blob/main/.config/kitty/kitty.conf)

Although one thing I'm missing in kitty from tmux is bindkey+z to maximize a panel. Looks like that is [possible](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/870). I should bind them both to be bindkey+` similar to Adobe products...
