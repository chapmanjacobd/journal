Hangul is not the full Korean language. Hangul is just a writing system like the alphabet. The alphabet is pretty easy to learn too. I think the biggest benefit here is not the inherent value of either the writing system or the oral language but how they're used together. if we really wanted to make English easier to learn then we could re-spell all the words in it to be more consistent but instead we use the spelling as a way to hide the history of a word
