MakeMKV

ffmpeg or LosslessCut or MPEG Streamclip and DNxHD (not strictly required but transcoding into an editing format will allow you to work faster)

Premiere Pro or Final Cut or Sony Vegas or KdenLive

You can always downsample media before editing to get a small file that is fast to play (so you don't necessarily need a supercomputer to edit 4K) then when you lock in your edit replace the file with the high quality file for final output
