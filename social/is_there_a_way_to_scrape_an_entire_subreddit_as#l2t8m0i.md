Then you can use pretty much any scraping tool. It doesn't have to be reddit specific. 

If you are interested in a full copy, something like [SingleFile](https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/SingleFile) can work. Or any of [these](https://github.com/lorien/awesome-web-scraping/blob/master/python.md#web-scraping) or [these](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/wiki/Web-Archiving-Community#the-master-lists)

If you are just interested in photos, gifs, and videos you can pipe the links to gallery-dl or yt-dlp.

If you are interested in text then it might make sense to use a reddit specific tool like praw or do something like [ArchiveTeam](https://old.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/142l1i0/archiveteam_has_saved_over_108_billion_reddit/). It really depends what content you want.
