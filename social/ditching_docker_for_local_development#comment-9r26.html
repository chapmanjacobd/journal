<p>I've seen some Nix recipes before and I wonder how much reproducibility for both Docker and Nix has to do more about "controlled vocabulary" / culture as an ability of being more opinionated vs a specific limitation in either technologies. I'm sure there is a way to create unreproducable builds within Nix by using "non-standard" or uncommon escape hatches and that is kind of the point. The default way is more reproducible with Nix vs the "unopinionated"-opinionated Docker</p>
