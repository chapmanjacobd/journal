<p>I would think that the biggest determining factor would actually be its estimated completion year. But it also depends what organizational structure led to the formation of that estimate. An estimate that was made at NASA with the NASA waterfall method for making Gantt charts is going to be a lot different than an estimate from SpaceX.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, if an estimate is only a few years away it means people have a pretty good idea how long it will take and that it is a smaller project (or that they being very ambitious or they know it will take longer but the short time-span is more exciting and they'll be able to string along investors so it doesn't matter that their estimate is inaccurate). If an estimate is far into the future then it means that it is a big project or that there are more unknowns. I would guess that the error bars are going to look a lot bigger for projects which take longer.</p>
<p>There is an element of Earnestness, an element of Scope (more interconnected parts or more diversity of occupational fields), and an element of Novelty that you would need to take into account while evaluating a project's estimate.</p>
<pre><code>Actual Duration = Estimated Duration * Estimate Earnestness * Scope * Novelty
</code></pre>
<p>(where a bigger Duration and Novelty also increases the error bars; I don't think Project Size really changes the error bars unless a project is badly managed--but a bigger Size / larger Scope make it more likely that there is more waste as different components just sit in warehouses while being blocked by other parts etc--however, an earnest estimate will account for the bulk of this)</p>
<p>If something takes longer to complete that also means it is more likely to be cancelled--especially as earlier political priorities and social inertia change. Also, the project may have originally been seen as an important scientific endeavor but the longer the project the more likely it is that we'll find satisfactory scientific answers through a smaller, cheaper experiment (or from a different branch of science altogether).</p>
