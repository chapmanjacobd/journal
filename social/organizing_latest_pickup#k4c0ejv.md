by the way, USPS packaging may be simple to obtain, but it's actually the property of the Postal Service. If you use these boxes in any way except to ship USPS Priority Mail or USPS Priority Mail Express, you're violating federal law.

You could probably keep using these but I would discourage you from getting more or encouraging others to do so.
