I would recommend Sagrada Família over Casa Mila if you only go to one of them. Skip the Sagrada Família tower--not really worth it.

I definitely prefer Battló over Mila as well. I think Mila is the weakest of them all--even Casa Vicens is a bit more interesting. I imagine at the time, Casa Mila was a phenomenal experience but you can kind of experience the same grandeur by walking through a very large American supercenter... it's just a very large building. 

But the Casa Mila cafe is free to go inside and not too busy. You can get a feel of the internal architecture and curving ceilings while sipping a coffee, etc.

If you have the time I would put _Cripta de la Colonia Güell_ at the same level as Casa Battló. It might be cheaper and less crowded than the others as well. I don't really remember. Colonia Güell is also an interesting town to walk around and learn about the history but not much to do or eat aside from historical sightseeing.
