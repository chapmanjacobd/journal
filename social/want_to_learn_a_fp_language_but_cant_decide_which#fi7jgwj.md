If I would choose again i think I would start with OCaml, Elixir, or Elm...

 Lisps are quite different from FP but they have unique features of their own. I wouldn't start with a lisp to understand FP but it's possible. I think elm is the most friendly introduction but it's pretty useless outside of frontend web apps
