<p>For temporal datasets there's likely a lot of redundant data across time: seasonal/solar/other cycles...</p>
<p>ArchiveTeam <a href="https://wiki.archiveteam.org/index.php/US_Government/War_room">does not specifically list</a> PDS as at-risk. But I am interested in distributed file systems--I think it would be possible to build a system that creates 7,000 torrents (each 500GB) of the PDS data (using the original URLs as web seeds) and index it like Anna's Archive so that people can see what is well-seeded or not. edit: ahh but this would require reading all the data at least once to build the hashes for the torrents</p>
