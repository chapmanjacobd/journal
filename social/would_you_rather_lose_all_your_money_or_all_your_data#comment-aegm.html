<blockquote>
<p><em>all</em> your data</p>

<p>I'm going to be pedantic for a little thought experiment.</p>
<p>if you lost access to all your data, does that also mean birth certificate, drivers license, cell phone number, all the internet cookies? I guess even if so, as long as you could still pay your bills on time it wouldn't be that bad. It would make it a pain to reset any 2FA accounts. Some accounts like PyPI, GitHub, and Google might be difficult to unlock if you lost access to all your metadata across devices (TOTP, IP address, etc); or does losing all your data mean all online accounts too? If that's the case then you probably lost all your e-banking and electronic money also. Your accounts don't exist any more.</p>
<p>If losing all the data means just local hard drives does that mean my phone and SSDs are safe? If so that doesn't seem that bad at all. I would still have a list of all the files that I lost. Anything that is important is backed up. It just means I wouldn't be able to watch TV or listen to music for a while:</p>
