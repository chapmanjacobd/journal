p stands for parent. But I am not an expert on the parent->post dichotomy. I figured this out because there is another attribute called `parent_whitelist_status` and `whitelist_status` and both contain the same values as `pwls` and `wls`

I think it's whitelisting related to advertisements but I don't know why it exists at the post level--I guess some types of advertisements can't be shown for certain types of posts? It does not seem to be tied to the subreddit but tied to the actual post
