<p>Yes, I'd feel odd about doing something like posting someone's personal blog in <a class="link-group" href="/~tech">~tech</a> with just their name in the title. But somehow in <a class="link-group" href="/~arts">~arts</a> it feels pretty normal.</p>
<p>I guess if it was a really well-known artist it does feel weird... but in <a href="https://xkcd.com/1053/">the sense</a> that I hadn't heard of <em>Rembrandt</em> or <em>Van Gogh</em>.</p>
<p>I should be less lazy though. This is partially just me making excuses but also I think I am <em>somewhat</em> justified that Artist Name is an acceptable title. But in the future I <em>will</em> try harder. I think for this one I could say: "Jessica Joslin: bone and metal sculpture"</p>
