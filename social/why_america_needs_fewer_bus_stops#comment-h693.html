<p>Counterpoint: USians are very lazy and won't walk more than one km to a bus stop</p>
<p>Also, just because it's marked as a stop doesn't mean the bus will stop there. I don't think I've been on a US bus that didn't skip stops if no one yanked the yellow rope or there were no people visible at the stop so the fixed stops are somewhat meaningless except for defining a route in navigation apps and, sometimes, shelter from the elements.</p>
<p>There are definitely stops in Chicago where I roll my eyes. It's like 100 meters between stops: before and after a bridge. However, the signalling system / stop lights are such that even if they removed the stop I think it wouldn't save much time--still need to wait for the green light and car traffic.</p>
<p>What makes US buses slow is frequency and distance of most trips. HK style route variations with 39A, 39B, 39C all skipping slightly different stops could help here--but mostly it is an issue of frequency.</p>
