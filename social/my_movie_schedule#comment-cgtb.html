<p>Great list! Hope you're able to stick to it.</p>
<p>If you have a list you can programmatically make an ICS file which you can import to Google Calendar pretty easily. I do a similar thing but for places around the world:</p>

<p>edit: ah I see your linked post. It would be cool if you could share the ICS file</p>
