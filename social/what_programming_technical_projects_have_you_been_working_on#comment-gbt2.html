<p>The meaning of some emoji will change over time. Some emoji like this one 🔣 already don't seem to have a clear use case. Oh, what is 〒 you ask? It's the Japanese postal mark of course! It's a strange symbol to choose for representing symbols because I don't think many people recognize it so they don't really know what  🔣 means.</p>
<p>The floppy 💾 is already becoming disconnected from its physical origin. Most young people can easily recognize it as the save icon but they have no idea what it is. Still, it's more recognizable than if developers started using File Cabinet 🗄️, Folder 📂, CD 💽, or Hard Drive 🖴 icons. Did that last one not show up? If people become too upset with an emoji the fonts people could just boycott it... Although that's probably not what happened here.</p>
<p>It's good that there are a lot of emoji. As long as people keep using the zero-width joiner character there isn't a lot of extra processing that the computer has to do to support more emoji combinations. It just means that font packages will get larger in size. NotoColorEmoji is about 10MB. Pretty big but it can easily fit in memory.</p>
<p>Forgotten emoji will still have a chance at being rediscovered and reinterpreted.</p>
<p>Also, certain patterns of emoji are memetic and will go through periods of use and disuse: 👁️👄👁️</p>
