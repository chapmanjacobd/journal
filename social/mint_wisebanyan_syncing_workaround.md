Thanks to /u/timruddell for pointing this out!!


You can add an Apex Clearing account directly to Mint. They're WiseBanyan's back-end partner.

    Find your account number on one of your monthly WiseBanyan statements. It'll look like: 0XX-12345-01

    Go to Apexclearing.com. Click "Login" > "Create a User ID" > "Next".

    Choose "10-Apex Clearing Corporation" from the Firm dropdown, and input the first 8 characters of your account number from step 1, without any hyphens, i.e. 0XX12345.

    Complete the rest of the account creation process (SSN, etc). You now have a username and password with Apex Clearing which is linked to your WiseBanyan account.

    Add a new Apex Clearing account in Mint using these credentials, and your WiseBanyan account balance is now reflected in Mint.

If you have additional apexclearing accounts (like traditional or roth IRA) you can add them to the same user account. Just choose add account then input "10-0XX12345"

NB: I'd recommend not messing around with anything (contact info etc.) in your Apex account. I'm not sure how WiseBanyan syncs with them, and you might break something, but this seems like a good solution for account aggregation purposes.
