<p>I don't have a handheld game device but your dock has USB right? I like the Logitech K400+ and similar devices.</p>
<p>It looks like you should be able to use Xbox One, PS4, PS5 controllers (though some people report <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/ROGAlly/comments/14ecvgk/dualshock_4_xbox_controller_on_asus_ally_i_cannot/">having trouble</a>). You could play it safe and just get an 8bitdo controller. Those are pretty good and probably a bit cheaper.</p>
