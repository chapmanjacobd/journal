When making categories it makes sense to think about clustering. But it is a personal choice: whether it makes sense to end up with categorize something in an existing folder or create a new one.

I recommend reading the pages on the https://johnnydecimal.com/ website. It has a range of ideas which might be helpful. I don't recommend adopting someone else's system of organization but rather build your own step by step. Unless you are required to use the dewey decimal system or something standardized.

My only piece of advice is to try to have a flat hierarchy with only one or two nested folders. I only use about 70 folders for all my data. I rarely use subfolders and it makes it very easy to manage and script things. But it took a long time to get to that point
