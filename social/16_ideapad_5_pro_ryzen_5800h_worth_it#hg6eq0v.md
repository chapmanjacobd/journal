There are a lot of laptops around this price point which are similar but many of them are preorder only. The 5800H is a beast. I think you won't go wrong with this CPU but it likely has some tradeoffs like cost, battery life, and weight.

  


Is the dGPU good enough for your needs? You might consider a faster graphics card with a slightly older CPU like the 4800H for the same price (However, the 5800H has quite a bit better single-core performance than the 4800H).

  


Not every game will use GPU, not every game will use CPU but most programs will benefit from low latency RAM so one thing I like to do is try to find the highest frequency and lowest CAS RAM. Of course with a laptop it likely comes with whatever RAM or it might even be soldered on and not upgradeable but usually the better choice is to choose the cheapest RAM from the laptop manufacturer and then source your RAM on your own. Think about what the bottleneck will be with the compute profile that you are most likely to run. The bottleneck is not always the CPU.
