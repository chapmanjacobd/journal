<p>I had a really good job interview in November with a great company. I did a better job presenting myself than I ever thought was possible. I've always been a bit shy, but now I feel less and less like I'm needed in society. Even though office jobs are often meaningless--it's nice to be a redundant part in the system. It's frustrating to be free: outside the system.</p>
<p>I don't have financial stress because I live very minimally--but this is a double-edged sword. Maybe if I had urgent needs I would change my behavior in a more productive way. Instead I have a lot of time to do the same things every day and dwell inside of this feeling. I'm not really depressed or suicidal at all but there is some fatigue about the state of things.</p>

<p>why isn't now a depression?</p>
<p>AI Overview<br/>
The current date, July 15, 2025, is not a depression because it refers to a specific date on the calendar, while "depression" refers to a mental health condition or, in some contexts, an economic downturn. The term "depression" is not related to the date.</p>
<p>why isn't now a recession?</p>
<p>The US economy is not currently in a recession because it does not meet the standard definition of two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth, and the labor market remains strong.</p>

<p>I was lucky before I suppose. I'm happy that I had a few prosperous years. I feel like I have sacrificed some social component to get good at programming. If anything it is <em>spent</em> time.</p>
<p>Concurrently, I don't have a strong desire to sit in a cubicle for 9 hours a day. I don't really <em>want</em> a job. I mean, I would love to sign on with a good team that had a supportive environment. But even more that that, I want to accept myself as who I am without a job. I want to be okay with being <em>retired</em> at 29. I want this to be normal. But it is not.</p>
