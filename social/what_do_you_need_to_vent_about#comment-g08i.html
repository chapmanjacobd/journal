<p>I had a really good job interview in November with a great company. I did a better job presenting myself than I ever thought was possible. They immediately ghosted me afterward.</p>
<p>I've always been a bit shy, but now I feel less and less like I'm needed in society. Even though office jobs are often meaningless--it's nice to be a redundant part in the system. It's frustrating to be free: outside the system.</p>
<p>I don't have financial stress because I live very minimally--but this is a double-edged sword. Maybe if I had urgent needs I would change my behavior in a more productive way. Instead I have a lot of time to do the same things every day and dwell inside of this feeling. I'm not really depressed or suicidal at all but there is some fatigue about the state of things.</p>

<p>why isn't now a depression?</p>
<p>AI Overview<br/>
The current date, July 15, 2025, is not a depression because it refers to a specific date on the calendar, while "depression" refers to a mental health condition or, in some contexts, an economic downturn. The term "depression" is not related to the date.</p>
<p>why isn't now a recession?</p>
<p>The US economy is not currently in a recession because it does not meet the standard definition of two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth, and the labor market remains strong.</p>

<p>I was lucky before I suppose. I'm happy that I had a few prosperous years. I feel like I have sacrificed some social component to get good at programming. If anything it is <em>spent</em> time.</p>
<p>Concurrently, I don't have a strong desire to sit in a cubicle for 9 hours a day. I don't really <em>want</em> a job. I mean, I would love to sign on with a good team that had a supportive environment.</p>
<p>But even more than that, I want to accept myself as who I am without a job. I want to be okay with being <em>retired</em> at 29. I want this to be normal. But it is not.</p>
<p>I am okay with humans not having traditional jobs. But maybe it will never feel normal <em>for me</em>.</p>
<p>My dad was (and still is) a workaholic. He doesn't know how to relax or have fun. Even in his rightfully earned twilight years, he can't stop doing projects--to the point that its strained familial relationships. He has his own backhoe instead of renting one but he only uses it a couple times per year. He expects everyone to help him do manual labor tasks in place of normal family reunion activities. He always picks the worst time to do things too like helping him unpack a cargo container in the dessert in the heat of the day at 2pm.</p>
<p>I feel like I know how to relax but somewhere inside of me there is an image of this over-industrious behavior defining what it is to be a man.</p>
