<p>Note: for THIS round of voting, I plan on moving forward with the top 6 since that was what was promised. I also think that, since the club is just starting, going with the most popular choices is going to be the most likely to generate momentum.</p>

<p>100% agree with this line of reasoning. Popular titles are generally popular for a reason and they shouldn't be excluded for getting too many votes or anything like that.</p>
<ol>
<li>vote decay: 30% would also be reasonable</li>
<li>culling: thinking about this more, maybe it should be a specific number instead of percent</li>
<li>voting options: This time was 39 titles and 10 few Arcade Specials, right? It may have been a bit too many for most people. I'm thinking 12 titles and 6 Arcade Specials would be ideal so that people can have more time to evaluate the different options. I guess there won't be an issue of not having enough nominations to fill the ballot. But if that were ever the case I think it would be good to bring a culled game back on the ballot...</li>
<li>I think Arcade Specials are that mechanism to a certain extent. By having different categories we allow for more diversity.<br/>
Also, CGA could choose from the top and bottom of the list so the first month we play the most popular and the least popular game under a different thread title or something like that. Or maybe a "Game Pack" similar to Arcade Specials where, during months that there isn't a popular-vote Arcade Special, there are 3-5 culled game titles and you choose one and play it.</li>
<li>I think the carryover idea is kind of complicated... I'm not necessarily against it but I wouldn't do it personally</li>
</ol>

<p>I see culling as very necessary for effective voting BUT I also feel a bit sad that additional effort is required to get people playing hidden gems or games that don't work well for the purposes of education and discussion. I think there should be some mechanism to use the effort of nominating and voting on culled games--without detracting from the magic that makes the popular titles popular.</p>
<p>This doesn't have to be solved by CGA directly; maybe I will make my own informal thread every so often where I play one of the culled titles that at least two people voted for or something.</p>
