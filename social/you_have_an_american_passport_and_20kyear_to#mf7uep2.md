> eastern Europe to settle down for six months and save, then spend the other six months traveling more expensive countries in western Europe

You'll be somewhat limited by Schengen Area rules. You'll need to spend 90 days outside the area for each 180 days. So you won't realistically be able to do that but you could do 3 months in Eastern Europe, go to Africa or Asia for 3 months and then go to Western Europe for 3 months. That sounds nice
