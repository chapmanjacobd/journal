<p>Huh... I enjoyed reading this more than I thought I would.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>I agree with the premise. It would be nice if there were more local options for building a distributed community (in spite of the irony). The appeal of being local is that they would be more responsive and responsible to the needs of the community, right? I could see that.</p>
<p>But nothing is really stopping your local organization from developing the same harm that Google is perceived as emitting. They are both organizations of people. If Google was a worker-owned co-op with solidarity, mutual aid, and all that; would there be anything 'wrong' with Google Photos? Is it just the organizational structure that needs to be changed?</p>
