I gave up since I have over 10 TB of music (all stored as Opus 90~120kbps; 2,051,153 audio files). I wrote my own software to organize in a very simple way: I scan my folders and play music. It's as simple as that.

To remove duplicates I wrote a music dedupe script which only takes 4 seconds to run. There might be a couple false positives but at this point I don't care. I already have enough music that I'll never be able to listen to it all in my lifetime. But if you only want to delete exact copies I recommend `rmlint`
