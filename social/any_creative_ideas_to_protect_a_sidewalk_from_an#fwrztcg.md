I'm in Vietnam and I think the best way to keep traffic slow is to just make the street have people walking on it. Maybe the culture is different from the US but higher curbs ain't gonna do shit. Higher curbs just means that the vehicle will be more out of control if it hits it--especially at those speeds. Lower curbs, more people on the street. Maybe close off the street or make it a single-lane one-way.
