If we look at the cost of a whole system we might be surprised how much some things cost (like cars) because there are a whole host of effects that come with the frequent use of cars.

They also  quickened their pace as if to hurry out of the dead zone. They picked up  considerably when they reached a stretch of restaurants and stores,  where (not surprisingly) they reported feeling a lot more lively and  engaged.

  Cars are not a necessity, even in rural areas, but because we have gotten used to cars we have designed cities in such a way that it is even harder to live without them. South Korea has a pretty good bus system such that there is a bus stop about every few blocks or so. It’s even more convenient than a car because you don’t have to worry about parking and it’s quite a bit cheaper (though some cars are very cheap).

  I can agree with the above statement. In my walks of Busan, the difference between one lane roads to ten lane roads is astronomical. A ten lane road world is basically unwalkable because things are so far spread out. Busan is a really good area to study this because there is a huge diversity in the way places are built. The area around Centum City and APEC-ro is designed for the use of cars. There is a generous sidewalk but it still takes on a completely different feeling from the nearby dense and designed-for-pedestrian areas.

 <p>
  The open-air surface parking lots often alienate the pedestrian as they walk within this liminal place. If you live next to WalMart it might feel like you’re breaking some unsaid rule when you walk across the vast parking lot to the store without using a car.

   Along with the economic imperative driving parking development were needs for legal and spatial regulations to stabilize the chaos forming in the wake of the combustion engine.

  Walking through a neighborhood of full of tall skyscrapers can make me feel small and disconnected with the environment. But does it make the people who finance or build skyscrapers feel powerful and connected to the environment? I'm not sure. it's an interesting question that I'd like to find the answer to. If you know any of these people, please ask for me. I'd like to know.
 </p>
 <p>
  But if I follow the line of reasoning in Personality of Place, then there are different personalities of environment. People connect with different places with different levels of comfort and engagement. If this is so then the building of place is political as certain groups of people will be benefited by those places and others will be emotionally pushed out of those spaces--regardless of whether they directly inhabit those spaces or not.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite being close to Busan, certain places in Tongyeong feel completely different from Busan. There are certainly still skyscrapers here but the geology is different. The city was built on top of a different natural environment. In this way the natural world heavily influences the political climate of the area. Where other cities might need stronger law enforcement to settle disputes, the shape of the city and the stress-relieving beauty that surroundings Tongyeong potentially dissipate negative emotions that would have otherwise led to a negative event.

  Motion of the environment influences local culture to be either more busy and harsh or more laid back and forgiving.

   Because of differences in topology, it can be much more expensive to build critical transportation systems like roads or train tracks which impacts the cost of everything else via taxation. It’s not bad that we build one 1.5 billion dollar bridge but do we really

   more than one? If the only goal is to cut the amount of traffic, maybe we can just help people to choose better lifestyles by making the costs of their choices more transparent. Maybe instead of taxing the whole state or nation for certain local projects, maybe it would be much better for people to see the costs and participate in the development of their local environment.

  Without emotional fusion with members of a place that we travel to then it is likely that we have experienced a place more as a liminal event rather than as an active participant within the place.

  If you pass through a small airport or a remote gas station your experience is much more absurd than if you worked there 9-5 Monday-Friday. At the very moment that emotional fusion within the space takes place, the space becomes a place of significance. It is regarded by the individual as being a place with meaning rather than empty or misunderstood space.

   The state of Israel and the site of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict serves as a liminal place as each side's existence depends on the negation of the other, creating an impossibly liminal situation in which both sides are betwixt and between what is normally expected of an autonomous society.
  </p>
  <p>
   The opposition between Israel and Palestine aims at diminishing the other when the end result is the creation of the opponent; thus, though they may try, one cannot exist without the other. The no man's land of space and place in identity, recognition, and homeland between Israel and Palestine is inherently liminal.

 <p>
  Our homes and native areas were once empty or misunderstood spaces. We moldered our current perception of the local environment over time. We can again discover new meaning within our everyday places through active exploration whether we use techniques of psycho-geographic dérive or not. We can take the recognizable and make it liminal once again or insert other contexts for our reinterpretation of the environment.
 </p>
 <p>
  Our liminal space may be someone else’s active space. Like the ocean is for  seafarers and the life that lives below. There is often a hierarchy  where the liminal is placed spatially underneath the space of the  creatures that are considered as "active". The creatures below are  active within their space though it is not often reported or thought about.
 </p>
 <p>
  The boundary between  air and water separates the worlds of fish and man. For man the depths  are a liminal space that he can only access for short amounts of time  even with advanced technology. For fish the space above the depths is one that few fish desire to enter. At least a few flying or air  breathing sea creatures have a concept of this boundary but I'm not sure  that all creatures below share this concept and it's very likely that  their "ideas" about the surface are much different whether they be  dolphin or mackerel.
 </p>
 <p>
  Places  that are unconnected to the people who are in them become liminal to  this kind of person. If a city dweller goes to a remote island without  any electronics or friends he might hate it for a while, adapt, then  like it. It's also possible for this type of person to like it immediately, adapt, and grow to love the new island life with  intermittent phases of missing his previous life. It depends on the  individual and the context of his arrival to the island.
 </p>
 <p>
  In  the same way all places have this feature. But the effects might be  more subtle. It depends on the specifics of the individuals personality  and the divergence of the environment to the characteristics of this  personality. The women’s section of a clothing store might be uninteresting, interesting to the individual, and to this same  individual there are varying degrees of indifference that the section could emminate depending on price, quality, utility, or style of the  products within but also the lighting, sounds, movement, colors, or  other architectural forms of the environment.

And yet the paradox here is that these two sets of passengers are going to the same place.

  A neighborhood is best if it can be both well connected to other neighborhoods but also self-sustainable. This type of neighborhood exists in many places around the world but it is no longer widespread as market forces seek to maximize.

Working and living a life close to home is not such a bad thing.

   Cultural norms are not completely separated from the environment though they can be self-referencing. More often, the norms are supported by and reference the environment. The norms very often cause laws to be made to further reinforce or protect the status quo. Norms dictate how strictly the laws will be enforced. Norms also nurture the characteristics of the average personality in the local environment. Norms influence how closely we

   the environment and determine how much the environment will influence us via self-reference.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  If the norm is to never litter garbage on the street then it can be reinforced in the environment by never seeing garbage in the street. But via self-reference the norm does not depend on the environment to be followed, instead it references itself. Say you live in New York and you see trash all over the street since you grew up but your family taught you that a respectable person does not do this and you see yourself as a respectable person so you don’t litter. In this case the norm references itself. When you see littered garbage you are reminded of your respectability rather than think to throw some more garbage onto the street. But you wouldn’t think to clean up after others unless that was an established norm within your personal community.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is different from a traveler visiting a place with streets more or less clean. In this case the traveler sees the divergence between expectation and reality as either freeing or destroying. The individual will need to develop a new but connected attitude to process the difference in environment. If the individual from New York came to a very clean place it would lead them to either believe that the people of this place were all respectable people (via symbolic misrepresentation) or it would destroy their belief that respectable people are defined by their ability to keep their streets clean once they see that even the “bad people” of this place don’t litter. Both interpretations are imperfect though the initial understanding of the New Yorker was a false dichotomy.

   Architectures of control are features, structures or methods of operation designed into physical products, software, buildings, city layouts–or indeed any planned system with which a user interacts–which are intended to enforce, reinforce, or restrict certain modes of user behaviour.

  <p>
   While the use of architectures of control in computing is well-known, and a current issue of much debate (in terms of digital rights management, ‘trusted’ computing and network infrastructures themselves), it is apparent that technology–and a mindset that favours controlling users–is also offering increased opportunities for such architectures to be designed into a wide range of consumer products; yet, this trend has not been commonly recognised.

   Architectural concepts such as natural surveillance demonstrate that certain forms of crime pose special dangers to society. These crimes target social networks and make it more difficult for interaction to develop. Examples are hate crimes, rape, and some other forms of violent crime that have the effect of creating stratification among divergent social groups. Others are some more minor crimes, from assaults to public urination.
  </p>
  <p>
   People who are afraid of being hurt do not venture outdoors, and so even a garden-variety assault, given the circumstance, may undermine natural surveillance. Similarly, if the sights and smells in a neighborhood are not pleasing, it is unlikely that people will walk the streets. Offenses that are considered trivial can thus have more dramatic consequences. Instead of focusing on the act involved in the commission of a crime, I am arguing that its probable consequences are relevant when apportioning punishment.
  </p>
  <p>
   One such consequence concerns complementarity. Complementarity is the economic notion that two products "go together" and that a price decrease in one will lead to additional consumption of the other. If offenses such as public urination have low "prices" attached to them, more of these offenses will be committed, and these may prompt additional, more serious offenses. The apportionment of sentences and of investigative and prosecutorial resources should take into account consequences of crime and, in particular, its harm to social networks.

   …by focusing on design, governments [may] forget about other goals of architecture, such as its aesthetic appeal. Until now we have been considering one facet of architecture-its ability to constrain crime. This facet is only one of the several values architecture serves. The emphasis on crime can, of course, run the risk of obscuring these other values. Such a result would stand the moves made in this Article on their head. To be faithful to architecture, law must first strive to understand these other values and then incorporate them into a crime prevention strategy through design.

   The word Politics is rooted in the word
  </span>
  <em>
   polis
  </em>
  <span>
   meaning ‘city’. If we look past the differences in ideology, the specifics of nomination, or the measured distance in political spectrum then we can start to see a clearer picture of what the Politic is and why it exists.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  The Politic is the judicial and executive movement of the group, the community, as a whole. It’s not a football game or something where success or failure is limited to subgroups. This is a much different phenomenon. The Politic only exists within local communities. It is symbolically extended to such extents as nation-states. In some countries the Politic is non-existent, in other countries it is sometimes the lowest level of law (Barangay Tanod, 交番 Koban, etc). The Politic can only exist and occupy within one place. Beyond the level of neighborhood, organizations only exist within hierarchy or hegemony. Judgement and execution always occur at the most local node of the governance graph.
 </p>
 <p>
  Cities, states, and nations don’t exist in the physical sense but are actually a network of neighborhoods. Neighborhoods are still very conceptual but they are physically connected in appearance, community, culture, socio-material, and spatial networks—nations fail to take on these qualities of structure because there is a distance across not just space but more importantly place. Nations are like books.
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   When you first open a book, you enter a liminal space.
  </p>
  <p>
   You are neither in this world, the world wherein you hold a book (say, this book), nor in that world (the metaphysical space the words point toward). To some extent this polydimensionality describes the feeling of reading in general—one is in many places at once.
