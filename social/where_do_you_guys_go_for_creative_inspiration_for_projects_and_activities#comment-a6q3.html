<p>I'm not offended by this confusion but it is unfortunate for both of us that we weren't able to have a successful interaction.</p>
<p>I think this post is fine as-is but you may want to make another post with a title that is more specific. Maybe something like "Where are the new websites for DIY project inspiration?"</p>
<p>But even with that you might not get the results that you want. These are all different niches:</p>
<ul>
<li>3D printing</li>
<li>miniature painting</li>
<li>home improvement projects</li>
<li>DIY electronics</li>
<li>Home decoration</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe you could make a post for each? But Tildes is still a bit of a small community so you could maybe try making one post per day about a different niche hobby and vary the question a bit. Something like "Who are your favorite Home decoration YouTubers?" could be good.</p>
