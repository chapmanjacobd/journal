<p>I don't think density is a requirement for car-free life. Food deserts are a real problem in the US but they are more acute / endemic to large, segregated cities. There are plenty of small towns in the US where everyone <em>could</em> bike everywhere in 15 minutes (right now--without any major infrastructure or lifestyle changes aside from changing their grocery shopping). But the problem is that everyone thinks that they need a car. I think for many smaller cities in the US there are fewer infrastructure barriers to car-limited/car-free living but mentally the people are further away from that reality; stuck like you say "behind a windshield, enclosed within their climate-controlled box of metal and plastic". They think car-free life is only possible in cities but I dare say some small towns in the US are far better than many major US cities (in terms of walkability, bikeability, and nearness to different zones).</p>
