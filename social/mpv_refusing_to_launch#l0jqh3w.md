It seems like a packaging/configuration issue on your distro:

I would try building from source or install a different distro

edit: For some people, installing another distro might be easier than building from source. There is nothing wrong with choosing Arch but it might be the wrong fit if your first instinct is to post a message without specific mpv version, system, and other configuration details other than the error message that you see
