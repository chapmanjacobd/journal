<p>Gen AI is really cool but it is also very dehumanizing. It can be both of these things at the same time.</p>
<p>Machines can now produce higher-quality output at much cheaper cost than the average specialist human with few artifacts that plagued early models. The reasons to choose a human over a machine grow smaller and smaller every day.</p>
<p>Ignoring the societal and economic impacts--if that is all sorted and the human race can learn to live on in some capacity... there is still a great blow to quality of life.</p>
<p>If different machines can do about as good as you in all sorts of specialized tasks--what should you focus on? How do you know that your time investment will be worth it? What meaning can there be of having a median skill set when a robot can perfectly replace your life?</p>
<p>What meaning can there be in learning to be a surgeon once the robot can do a far better job at working for extended periods of time? Before the robo-doc existed you were needed and now you are not. Knowledge and skills atrophy because they aren't being regularly used or developed. Now society can only access average surgeries and no one has developed the muscle dexterity to perform advanced surgery. Maybe nano-bots will eventually be feasible enough to close the gaps but it's also possible that nanobots cannot compete effectively within the physical constraints that exist.</p>
<p>Rich people might be satisfied with AI ghostwriters in place of human ghostwriters. Will their readers be the wiser? Maybe, maybe not. But people who genuinely want to feel that they've created something, that they've earned their place in the world, will be up against enormous competition.</p>
<p>Writing this out... maybe it's not so bad... it's not so different from globalization. The entrenchment and monopolization of distribution is the worst part. Controlling Gen AI is a similar consolidation of power.</p>
