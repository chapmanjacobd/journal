<p>Gen AI is really cool but it is also very dehumanizing. It can be both of these things at the same time.</p>
<p>Machines can now produce higher-quality output at much cheaper cost than the average specialist human with few artifacts that plagued early models. The reasons to choose a human over a machine grow smaller and smaller every day.</p>
<p>Ignoring the societal and economic impacts--if that is all sorted and the human race can learn to live on in some capacity... there is still a great blow to quality of life. Rich people might be satisfied with AI ghostwriters in place of human ghostwriters but people who genuinely want to feel that they've created something, that they've earned their place in the world, will be up against enormous competition.</p>
<p>Writing this out... maybe it's not so bad... it's not so different from globalization. The entrenchment and monopolization of distribution is the worst part. Controlling Gen AI is a similar consolidation of power.</p>
