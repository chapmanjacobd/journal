<p>To be honest, it's a difficult time to be a programmer right now. I also live in a rural area and apply to at least 5 jobs per day. Sometimes 10 or 20. Sometimes those applications take less than a minute. Other times those applications take over an hour to respond to the questions asked and provide a cover letter. I've only had a handful of interviews over the last couple years. It sucks.</p>
<p>I have over six years of experience and I'm a pretty solid programmer, but I'm not good at self-introductions or talking about myself in high-stress situations (when you only get a called every couple months... the stakes of even the recruiter screening becomes increasingly terrifying).</p>
<p>The modern business cycle is largely meme-driven (or at least pretends to be as an excuse for certain actions like hiring or layoffs). Right now a lot of administrative and managerial positions believe in the promise of GenAI. Before GenAI it was Web3, Blockchain, and Crypto. It will take a good five or ten years more until their strategy either pays off or not. It's a good time to start your own business doing things that people need/want. It's a good time to get a loan to build a GenAI startup...</p>
<p>For employment, I think it makes a lot of sense to target smaller and local businesses. I live in a small rural area too. It's tough out here... but our environments have strengths as well. My advice is to not join the gig economy but instead try to develop relationships with local businesses. Get to know who the decision-makers are. Find out who the hiring managers are. Ask them what kind of jobs they'd like to see as prior experience or if there are any opportunities for low-commitment contract work or internships to prove yourself.</p>
<p>If I had to get a job immediately right now, <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/HVAC/comments/1bv8lrh/apprentices_how_did_you_manage_to_get_your_job/">HVAC</a> seems safe and pretty easy(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsnQeUSuUMU">?</a>) once you understand the basics (compared to something like being an Electrician or Plumber where there is a lot more counterintuitive stuff to learn or welding/carpentry where the expectation is generally longer hours and more physical dexterity). Sure, you're occasionally moving heavy stuff and occasionally in small dirty spaces. But you can make good money for a few hours of work. As an introvert I'd rather do this type of work than to do a user-facing IT support role (which I've done before).</p>
