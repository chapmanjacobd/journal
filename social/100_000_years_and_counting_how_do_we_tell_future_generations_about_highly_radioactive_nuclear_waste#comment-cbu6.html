<p>It makes me think about the <a href="https://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/Publications/PDF/Pub815_web.pdf#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A196%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22Fit%22%7D%5D">Goi√¢nia incident</a>...</p>
<p>I think any indication that there is something buried is worse than leaving the land as boring as possible. I think the location is important: bury it tens of meters deep and far from bodies of water so that future human settlements are not likely to go there. There are places in the world where fewer animals live simply because they are so far from water--those are the ideal places to put this stuff</p>
