<p>we alienate ourselves from our uniqueness and our soul. Why read a boring book when this streaming service is constantly getting new movies? Why make art when AI can make it for me if I ever need it?</p>

<p>Both you and I know that the content of larger studios and independent productions differ wildly. Studios tend to reproduce the mean. They regurgitate the same safe stories that people expect when they desire to be entertained.</p>
<p>AI is also doing this. Reproducing what is expected. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14547">Universal regressors</a>. Also, there's a growing number of people that <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/replika/">just chat with AI</a> instead of talking to other humans (but maybe this isn't replacement for "traditional" book/video content).</p>
<p>I agree that apathy is growing--on two sides. If someone <em>prefers</em> poorly-written soap operas, and they <em>prefer</em> a poorly-written soap from 50 years ago over a modern soap... then there isn't much of a meaningful difference between these two versions of the same preference. They might learn some things about the past by watching the old one but they also fail to learn new things from not watching the new one.</p>
<p>Likewise, there are plenty of very intelligent and capable writers today, do they not also deserve a chance? Old content only benefit the rights holders, AI, and those with writers block (great artists steal, etc). If we were an efficient species and only moderately vain... we really have enough content already. We don't actually need to make any more films or books. There are far more films made than can be watched in one lifetime. There are more pages printed than eyeballs that can read them. There is more music than can ever be heard. We don't really need to create more.</p>
