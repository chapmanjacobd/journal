I've noticed that many of these "[Real Name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-name_system#China)" identity verification require you to put your lastname first (and no comma) even with no instructions that say to do that but otherwise it should work with a passport once you've entered HK. 

If you already have HKID then I imagine it doesn't matter where in the world you verify as long as the server is reachable--but with a passport you need to get in the system first and governments almost never share name databases.

But yeah... I would recommend just going to the China Mobile counter at HKG. It's a lot easier
