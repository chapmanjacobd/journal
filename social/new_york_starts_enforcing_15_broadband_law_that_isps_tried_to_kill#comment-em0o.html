<p>I would say "needs updat<em>ing</em>" but the word <em>updating</em> in this context irks me a bit... It's not the speed that is being <em>upgraded</em> rather it is the infrastructure which can support the higher speed.</p>
<p>Actually, I don't think the word <code>updating</code> can apply to speed. You can measure the speed of something and you can update your measurement but you can't really update speed--only increase or decrease it. Because speed is something that exists within the context of time it is always updating...</p>
