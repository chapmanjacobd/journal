I would say the Wasteland series is about as close as you could get to this idea. It's not a city builder but it's main mechanic is an RPG where you are fighting people but there's a lot of diplomacy and choosing which factions should flourish.

The Frostpunk series has many city building elements but the focus is on survival and not necessarily just resource efficiency. If you can get past the few city building aspects there's even more governance involved here than Wasteland.

Road 96 is definitely not a city builder and the storyline is more fixed than the other games but there's similar themes. You don't get to choose any details about how the government is rebuilt but your choices can affect the political scene.

State of Decay is similar to Wasteland but with Zombies.

Kenshi, Sable, Planescape: Torment, are all worth checking out for different reasons but they don't get too deep into governance.
