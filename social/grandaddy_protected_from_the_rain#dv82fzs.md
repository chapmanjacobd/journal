    
    Hello my name is on my shirt...pocket
    I'd rather not speak right now
    I'm remembering... something
    
    Most typically my dreams are dreadfully
    Boring
    Therefore i go to these places just to
    See the girls ...
    With hair like hers
    With clothes like she wore
    With smells like hers
    With handwriting like hers .....
    
    You wrote me little letters and
    You brought me lunch that time
    At my work and that poem you left
    On my windshield wrapped in plastic
    To protect it from the rain
    
    Protected from the rain (several times)
