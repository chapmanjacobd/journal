I have the IdeaPad Pro 5 14 (China edition 8845 H with 6400 MHz RAM). The processor is extremely powerful but it's very energy hungry unless you lower the frequency/TDP target. 

By default you'll likely get less than 2 hours battery life (84wh / 45w) but if you lower the energy usage to around 4w you should be able to get 20 hours battery (84wh / 20 hours = 4.2w).

If you are doing anything with CUDA the rtx 3050 will be nice to have but the 780m is pretty good for gaming! If you are chasing fps then the dedicated graphics will obviously be better but if you are a casual gamer like me there isn't as big of a difference this year compared to a few years ago--especially with the 32GB RAM
