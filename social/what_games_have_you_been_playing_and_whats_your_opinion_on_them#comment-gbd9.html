<p>limiting FPS usually helps a lot. Even though I have a 160hz refresh rate ultra-wide, I typically cap my FPS at 24 to 30 but turn on Vsync.</p>
<p>(even if your computer is rendering at a higher FPS (e.g., 120 FPS), a 60 Hz monitor can only show 60 of those frames each second--though it could show more via partial frames with screen tearing)</p>
