Historically, the motivating reasons were mostly performance, especially with regard to table joins--you will find that the database is using it's own identifiers to find specific rows anyway: pages, blocks, tuple identifiers, etc. It was never about finding specific rows within a single table. It's not that much more space to save a UUID, but it is many times slower to compare UUIDs instead of sequences and indexes fragment a lot more when adding/removing UUIDs
