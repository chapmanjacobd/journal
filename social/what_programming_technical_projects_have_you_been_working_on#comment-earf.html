<p>The past couple weeks I took a break from my other projects and <a href="https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/library/compare/v3.0.027...v3.0.030">wrote a few utilities</a> for automating qBittorrent.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first one, <code>torrents-add</code> extracts data from torrent files and imports it into a SQLite database.</li>
<li>The second, <code>computers-add</code> scans computers via SSH and sees how active the disks are over 5 minutes and how much free space there is.</li>
<li><code>allocate-torrents</code> uses the data generated by the first two commands to allocate the biggest torrents to the largest free space drive until either all torrents or all free space has been allocated (with a default buffer of 50GiB).</li>
<li><code>torrents-info</code> shows some interesting stats so that it is easier to use <code>qBittorrent-nox</code> from the CLI without needing to open a web browser. You can also use this subcommand to search for specific torrents or files of torrents and print that info or delete them from qBit.</li>
<li><code>torrents-stop</code> helps to filter out torrents where the activity has died down. I use this in conjunction with <code>process-media</code> to extract data from archives (<code>iso</code>, <code>rar</code>, etc) and shrink it down so that I can seed more stuff...</li>
</ul>
