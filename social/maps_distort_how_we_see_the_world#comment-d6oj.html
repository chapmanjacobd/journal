<p>with maps having such an important role in our everyday lives, we still use maps that are so obviously wrong</p>

<p>I think the biggest reason is that people are used to seeing what they have seen for their whole lives and any accurate maps look weird and wrong to them so they think the more accurate maps are incorrect.</p>
<p>But the Earth is 3D. Flat maps always have tradeoffs. The Mercator map is actually one of the best maps to use if you are using it for navigation purposes: a straight line on the map will show the correct direction to go to get to your destination. This is not true at all for maps that accurately show the size of regions.</p>
<p>I work with spatial data/GIS for a living. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South-up_map_orientation#Psychological_significance">psychological consequences of South-Up</a> maps might seem a bit far-fetched but I think there is something to it. I think humans are not very good at reading maps. Our brains are better at recognizing faces or other patterns like that. I don't think accurate and unbiased map reading can be casually taught... I'm not even sure if it is possible to do. If you already have a destination in mind, sure. Navigation maps are great. But for looking at a map to decide where to travel, where to invest, where to live, where to build... I think humans are much better at reading sorted tables of information. There's a lot of really interesting spatial data that can be used to supplement/enrich the table of data. And leave the map-browsing to the very end, for fine-tuning decisions while constraints are well-defined.</p>
