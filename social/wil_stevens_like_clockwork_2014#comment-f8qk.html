<p>Okay I think all of these songs are covers(?) of the band <em>Queens of the Stone Age</em>. Pretty good band.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if these are true covers or simple pitch-shifting edits but I these weird covers a bit more than the originals</p>
<p>edit: ok I'm pretty sure this is simple pitch-shifting. maybe I should file this one under guilty pleasures...</p>
