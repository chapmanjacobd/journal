> the hash of the build on F-Droid is the same as the one in github

It should be noted that the Syncthing-Fork F-Droid is under control of researchxxl as his repo is the one the builds are based off of...

but I think you are just referring to Syncthing Fork v2.0.11.2, right? That version is widely regarded as being the last Catfriend1 release and I agree it is good that the hashes match. So nothing nefarious is _likely_ going on--just people learning on the job (though it is still not _completely_ outside the realm of possibility of state-sponsored action)
