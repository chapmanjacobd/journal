<p>I never had something like this happen. I use Sync too and it works great except for the occasional tab being sent to the great <code>/dev/null</code> in the sky instead of across the room.</p>
<p>This might sound silly but be sure to check <code>about:profiles</code> and try "Restart with Addons disabled" when this happens. Also check that it is using your old profile and not some new one that it created.</p>
<p>Also, try Firefox straight from Mozilla instead of through package managers or other distribution channels. I've found that the auto-update behavior is less annoying than going through Fedora DNF--I guess you are on Windows so maybe this doesn't apply</p>
