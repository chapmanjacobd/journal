Plenty of small-ish but modern apartments available in Da Nang for $200/mo.

I'd recommend staying as long as possible. Airfare between countries will quickly eat up your money. Unfortunately, the tourism visas for VN and ID are only 1 month so I'd research alternative visa options for both countries. If you can figure out a way to stay in each country for 3 months I would say it is doable.
