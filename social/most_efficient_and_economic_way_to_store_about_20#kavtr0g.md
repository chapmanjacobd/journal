It depends. If the other environmental factors are the same (mostly temperature, humidity--but other things exist which can influence decay), I would say that even idling is likely to be better than cold storage. 

But it also depends how the OS is using the drive, and what the disk firmware is doing. It's best if the filesystem on the disk supports [scrubbing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_scrubbing#File_systems) so that you can monitor whether data is still readable over time.



All information eventually gives way to entropy.

The only real solution is constant refresh, validation, and multiple copies of data. The only reason we know about many historical things is due to multiple copies of organisms existing and we are able to find the lucky ones that were preserved in tree sap.

Likewise, we are lucky to find old stories because they were passed down through constant rehearsal in oral tradition and/or because some crazy guy brought some scrolls up to a mountain. There are probably many scrolls that we don't know about because they weathered away. We just find the lucky ones. It's chance.

Analog may last longer than digital data but I wouldn't trust just one type of storage. If you care about something you need to have multiple copies and validate that the data is still readable every year or at the very least 5-10 years. If (VHS) players are no longer manufactured you also need to consider that aspect as well.

Even stone tablets have bitrot at a timescale of months if the conditions are right

Given your use case it is likely enough. You probably don't _need_ backups or RAID but you should still research them for yourself. 

It sounds like you should care more about being strict about **where** you keep files that you care about and don't store them in the same place with the files you don't care about--and also keeping a list of files so you know what is gone when a disk irrecoverably dies. 

If it is too expensive to care about all the data you have, apply the 3-2-1 rule to the data that you care about.
