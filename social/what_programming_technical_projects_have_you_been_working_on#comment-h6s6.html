<p>I wrote <a href="https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/computer/blob/main/bin/folders.merge.common.py">a script to help merge folders which share the same name</a> excluding some folder names like "Disc 01", etc. It merges into the folder which has the shallowest depth. You can add more exclusions with -E name (add a path separator (ie. name/) to exclude all subfolders too)</p>
<p>I think the funnest part was creating the list of default folders to ignore. After excluding some patterns it's surprising how few common folder names there are. Seems like shallow folder hierarchy makes a lot of sense as long as it stays performant.</p>
