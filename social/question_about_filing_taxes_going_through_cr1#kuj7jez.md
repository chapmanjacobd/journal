hmm I was able to file an extension on freetaxusa without putting in an ITIN (although I put 999-88-9999 as a placeholder on the main return; if they re-used this in the extension application it was not obvious in the UI! Still, the extension was approved by the IRS after a couple hours)

I think I'll wait to file as well. If my spouse doesn't have an ssn by then I was planning to follow the same advice above and file by mail since NRA will be rejected by e-filing supposedly.

Thanks

edit: this link has some helpful advice too https://old.reddit.com/r/tax/comments/hpxd3y/my_wife_doesnt_have_ssn/
