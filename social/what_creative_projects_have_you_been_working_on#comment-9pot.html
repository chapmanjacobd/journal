<p>I've been recording most of my ideas / journals publicly (some of these are more than 10 years old but I just made them public): <a href="https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/journal/tree/main/public">https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/journal/tree/main/public</a></p>
<p>Similarly, I've been religiously recording my dotfiles by making my whole home folder a git repo: <a href="https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/computer/">https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/computer/</a></p>
