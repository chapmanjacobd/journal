<p>Maybe this is unrelated but watching a video like, "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWAR_DotvZs">Why a Hass Avocado Seed Does Not Give Us a Hass Avocado Tree</a>" makes it seem like grafting and having a consistent flavor profile would be really hard to scale--if only from a quantity of material perspective.</p>
<p>Is there ever not enough cuttings to meet demand?</p>
