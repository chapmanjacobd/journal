<p>With 4.1cm clearance on both sides I would have to think it would be fine. It might help to have a negative pressure fan (outside the case) at the rear or in front of the unit just so there's not hot air building up in your desk.</p>
<p>Depending on your definition of "newer stuff" integrated chips have gotten pretty powerful in the last few years and plenty of them can play the latest Triple-A games on medium and sometimes high quality settings--depending mostly on how well the game is optimized (and if you limit the max resolution and FPS rendered... you don't need 4K right?). If you need a dedicated GPU you probably aren't going to get away with fanless* but if you can there are a lot of <a href="https://store.minisforum.com/collections/new-arrival">neat</a> and <a href="https://www.shuttlecomputers.com/products">cute</a> low-profile options.</p>
<p>* Though there are some options:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The case alone costs €790 (minus any optional extras), pre-built systems start from €2850 for the Extremely Fanless option and go up to €3600 for the Insane spec</p>
