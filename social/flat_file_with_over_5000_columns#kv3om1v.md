Since they lose access on Friday I would try to see how big the data is. If you can store it in cloud storage, after calculating the costs, I would spend the first week writing/running a script to download everything leaving the format as-is except for compression. Then, if you don't have enough time to do proper transformation communicate to your manager early what the actual timeline should look like
