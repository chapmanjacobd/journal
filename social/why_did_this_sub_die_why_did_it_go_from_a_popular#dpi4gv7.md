I can only speculate. I found this sub somewhat recently--maybe 10 months ago.

Taking a look at [a graph of the total subscribers for this sub](http://redditmetrics.com/r/trueMusic) it seems like this subreddit had a large number of new subscribers. People probably just forgot that it exists and they stopped posting here
