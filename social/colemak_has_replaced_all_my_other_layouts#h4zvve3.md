> (on Colemak Academy) it doesn't even type in colemak! Some weird, random layout replaces it instead (qwt;dniljo is my top row)

this is probably because your keyboard is doing colemak or africaans or something and then the Colemak Academy (I'm assuming, never used) probably expects you to have a QWERTY keyboard layout and their site will translate QWERTY into Colemak so it's probably doing the conversion twice: once on your computer and once in Colemak Academy
