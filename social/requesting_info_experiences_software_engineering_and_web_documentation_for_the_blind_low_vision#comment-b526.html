<p>ADA-compliant CLI is a very interesting idea. It looks like a few people at Google did a small paper: <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3411764.3445544">https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3411764.3445544</a></p>
<p>edit: One thing that I do in my CLIs is output all tables as GitHub style markdown tables. This might be an easy lift for your product. I don't know that this will solve any grievances for low-vision people but at least it makes it easier for all people to copy and paste tables into a spreadsheet. I'm sure it would be a step up from an arbitrarily formatted ASCII table</p>
