<p>My wife was emailed the "correct answers" for one of these types of personality tests when applying for a job at a company that her friend works at. It's kind of funny that it was like a <strong>50 MB</strong> word document (many pages of screenshots) and seemed to be a few years old (the Windows clock was 2019) because of this I doubt she was the first recipient of the answers file.</p>
<p>If people are already friends then they'll probably work well together. I wouldn't assume at face value that any HR survey is written or conducted with the same methodology as a double blind "Big 5" controlled experiment. So the results of higher employee performance might just be from arbitrary gatekeeping and existing human networks who know the right handshakes</p>
