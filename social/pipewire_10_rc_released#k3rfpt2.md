I switch between screens at several times in the day and I've found it is best to just script around these issues so you aren't spending time fiddling around in GUIs trying to fix all the weird problems. Then set a global shortcut in you WM to switch between specific configurations.

I use KDE (with krohnkite active only when using my ultra-wide display) but you should be able to do a similar thing in whatever DE

Example: [sit down desk](https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/computer/blob/main/.config/fish/functions/sitdown.fish), [stand up desk](https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/computer/blob/main/.config/fish/functions/standup.fish), [living room TV](https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/computer/blob/main/.config/fish/functions/tv.fish)
