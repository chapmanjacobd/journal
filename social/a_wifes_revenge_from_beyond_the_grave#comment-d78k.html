<p>It's possible that the girls are lying now, because they know that their father is their only living parent and they want to stay on his good side</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I also imagined this possibility while reading the article. I don't doubt that the article is not biased in favor of the father in some ways, but the article also reflects on that when it says the the truth is probably somewhere between her and his side of the story.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I see no names cleared</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this story does the job of presenting the evidence in a more impartial way (or at least presenting an alternative view) than the articles that were written before it. The article cannot undo the damage that the existing narrative has caused. Beyond documenting the other side of the story I think this article does a good job at showing some of the problems in contemporary life. It's a warning about trusting single sources of information and it's a warning about what it is like to be infamous.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I hope that one day, those girls have the opportunity to have their own truth heard</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hope that this article is close enough to the truth to bring some closure to their lives. It would be very horrible if this article was more concealing than revealing</p>
