<p>Sometimes I'll find them on digital gardens. Other times category pages of wikis or websites.</p>
<p>For example, most recently I came across the site HiLobrow.com. It's a weird domain name. I guess it stands for Highbrow/Lowbrow... Anyway. From the couple of articles that I read, I like the content on the site. But it is way too much for me to read in one sitting! So I went to the <a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/sitemap.xml">sitemap.xml</a> and then looked at the different types of URLs on that page. The page category didn't seem very interesting so I just grabbed all 10,000 or so of the post URLs.</p>
<p>To give you an idea of the scope of different domains. It looks like I have 19,985 unique second-level domains. Here are my top ones:</p>
