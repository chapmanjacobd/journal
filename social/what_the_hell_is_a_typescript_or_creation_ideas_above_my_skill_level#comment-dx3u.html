<p>All mature programs have incidental complexity which is built up over time as edge cases are discovered and patched around.</p>
<p>There is no perfect programming language but some languages make this incidental complexity more hidden via language implementation, packages, classes or modules; and some languages are very verbose.</p>
<p>Types can help <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_purpose_of_a_system_is_what_it_does">but really there is a lot of overlap</a> with unit tests. Whether you write your code twice as types or as tests it doesn't really matter that much. But I would say types are more useful in compiled languages because typing is more strict and you are more likely to be forced to write types that fit all of your input specifications.</p>
<p>But the most important thing when learning something new is to have a comfortable environment with short feedback loops. You can use <code>vitest</code> on backend code--I'm not sure what the best <code>js/ts</code> dev tools are for node but I have found <code>vitest</code> much better than <code>jest</code></p>
