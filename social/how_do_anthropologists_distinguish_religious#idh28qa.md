I'm not sure those practices mentioned are entirely superficial. Religion strictness and solumness varies between groups of people and between individuals. Some people might be religious about the Olympics or superstitious about things to eat. I'm not sure these categories can be cleanly separated.

From an external point of view, these are all things that people do not out of a necessity to survive but because they believe that they should honor the ideas.

For some people nationalism was/is equivalent to religion. For some people today, where we have a more clean delimitation between country and church, serving the nation is their "religion" and they would do the same things that people do to appease a deity.
