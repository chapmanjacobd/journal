<p>A bit <em>cheesy</em> but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncFnuAsUXUI">Who Reviewed my Review Better? Plus Unboxing Unboxing Video</a> reminds me a bit of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKjmDPGJI-4">Final Deployment 4: Queen Battle Walkthrough</a></p>
<p>On a more serious note, this video, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69AOVtOUatY">The Making of Sonic the Hedgehog</a>, made me appreciate Sonic more. It made me think about how unique the game is! It really is perhaps the best video game <a href="https://youtu.be/GPzVlTgZoCg?t=206">since pacman</a></p>

<p><em>Aside</em>: Civ. 6 will be free on the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/free-games">epic game store</a> this week starting in 9 hours... but it <em>is</em> Civ 6. So... not that great...</p>
