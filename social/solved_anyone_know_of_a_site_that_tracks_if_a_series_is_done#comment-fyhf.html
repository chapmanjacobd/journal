<p>I'll usually watch a season at a time because after a year or two it's 50/50 whether the show will continue to be available on the streaming platforms that I have access to.</p>
<p><em>But I will use</em> Wikipedia which will <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_Drones#Episodes">very often</a> have a table of the future episode release dates and I'll add a calendar event to remind me a couple days after the last episode will finish airing.</p>
