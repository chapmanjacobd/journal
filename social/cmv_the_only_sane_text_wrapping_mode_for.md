The 'Clip' text wrapping mode is clearly superior for spreadsheets compared to 'Overflow' or 'Wrap'. With 'Clip', text that is too long for a cell is simply cut off rather than spilling over into adjacent cells or wrapping within the cell. This prevents issues with data being obscured or misaligned, and maintains the grid-like structure that makes spreadsheets usable. 

'Overflow' is terrible - you end up with text bleeding all over the place, destroying any sense of organization. 'Wrap' isn't any better - long text ends up ridiculously stacked within cells, again disrupting the clean grid layout that spreadsheets rely on. 

'Clip' is the only sane option that preserves readability. Spreadsheets are for structured data, not freeform text. The default should absolutely be 'Clip' text wrapping to maintain spreadsheet sanity. Anything else results in a visual mess that defeats the purpose of a spreadsheet.
