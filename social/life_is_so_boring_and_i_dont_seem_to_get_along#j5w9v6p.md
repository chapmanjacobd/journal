You must follow your own path but I recommend that you plan ahead with measurable and actionable goals.

A lot of people go to bars or churches because other people go, not necessarily because they like to drink or because they believe in some foreign deity. Perhaps you judge people too quickly for their surface level camouflage. Some people are flat and some are shallow but most people have many faces. People don't owe you anything just as you owe others nothing. It may be solely up to you to set the context for finding the face that you want to see from specific individuals. Reciprocity is the foundation of human relationships.

> I want to find someone to challenge my thoughts and do some cool shit

You'll be more productive if you can challenge yourself. It sounds like you are already used to introspection and reflexivity so it is likely you don't actually need this. Friends come and go, sometimes too often. It helps to stay in one place for a while. It can take a while to find the right person but if you aren't putting yourself out there and interacting with people it's likely that you'll never find someone.

I asked ChatGPT if it had some advice and it said this:

- Choose the right equipment. The type of fish you're targeting will determine what kind of rod, reel, and bait you'll need.

- Learn about the fish you're targeting. Each species has its own habits and preferences, so it's important to understand where they live and what they like to eat.

- Be patient. Fishing can be a waiting game, so it's important to be patient and not get discouraged if you don't catch anything right away.

- Fish at the right time. Fish are most active during certain times of the day, so it's important to know when they're most likely to be biting.

- Try different techniques. Different fish respond to different techniques, so it's a good idea to experiment with different methods until you find one that works for you.

- Respect the fish and the environment. Fishing is a great way to connect with nature, but it's important to remember that you're a guest in the fish's home and to take care not to harm the environment.

- Learn local regulation and laws . Remember to check the local regulations and laws about fishing and get a valid fishing license if required.

Haha. I hope my humor was well-received. But the advice is pretty spot on... just replace fish with friends
