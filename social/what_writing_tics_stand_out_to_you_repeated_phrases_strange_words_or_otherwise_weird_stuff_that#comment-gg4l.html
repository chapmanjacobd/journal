<p><em>I'm picking up what you're throwing down</em>: verbal crutches...</p>
<p>I would say these conversational platitudes are more like clichés. Phrases that pejorate into meaninglessness but are still heavily used regardless, for filler.</p>
<p>But clichés do not hold an exclusive monopoly on words that <em>irk</em>. When something <em>begs the question</em> I beg to get out of there.</p>

<p>There's one that really bothers me but I can't think of it right now. I'll update this comment when it comes to me</p>
<p>edit: okay I was looking for "not for nothing"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The phrase functions as a kind of verbal throat-clearing, a way to preface a point that a character feels is particularly important, insightful, or even a bit rude. It's often used before giving an opinion, a critique, or a piece of blunt advice.</p>

<p>"Not for nothing, I told you this would happen."</p>
<p>It's such a bizarre double negative phrase--if you're not familiar with it. It literally means "for something" but it doesn't tell you what the "for something" that it's about.</p>
<p>But I imagine if you've heard it all your life it sounds bob is your uncle</p>
<p>don't think about it <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/etymology/comments/e0xcz4/by_the_way_what_does_that_mean/">too hard</a></p>
