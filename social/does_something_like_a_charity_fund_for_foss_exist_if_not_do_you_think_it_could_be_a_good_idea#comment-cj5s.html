<p>This centralized curation is a tricky problem. Although there have been many interesting systems like <a href="https://snowdrift.coop/">Snowdrift.coop</a>, most of these projects are either not very successful or the money flows are biased towards a specific group of people.</p>

<p>Then don't. A few large direct donations will do more good than many small donations even while it might <em>feel</em> like you are doing more good.</p>
<p>Donate to the projects that you like or use the most. If everyone did that then we would enjoy the benefits of decentralized curation.</p>
