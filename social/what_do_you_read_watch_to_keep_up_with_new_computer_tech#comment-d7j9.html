<p>To answer some of your other prompts more directly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... desktops? Laptops? Cyberdecks? Is [using a laptop exclusively] reflective of a more general shift?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Absolutely, I think there's always been a desire to be both productive and not limited to working in a single location. Since the arrive of the SSD, there's been fewer and fewer reasons to buy desktops. And more and more people are working exclusively from their phones--they don't need laptops. I think--if you can be productive on a phone you can be productive on a cyberdeck... but I would rate ergonomics and portability of various platforms like this:</p>
<p>Ergonomics: Desktops, Cyberdecks in "desktop" mode, Handheld game consoles (steamdeck, etc), Laptops, Phones, Highly-portable Cyberdecks, Tablets</p>
<p>Portability: Phones, Tablets, Laptops, Handheld consoles, Cyberdecks, Desktops</p>
<p>To explain myself a bit:</p>
<p>Desktops can be the most ergonomic because there is a <a href="https://shop.keyboard.io/products/model-100">wide</a> <a href="https://www.rtings.com/monitor/reviews/asus/proart-display-pa278qv">variety</a> of <a href="http://www.ergoquest.com/zero-gravity-workstations.html">peripherals</a> and they support the most input/output devices.</p>
<p>Laptops and Cyberdecks <em>can</em> be used like Slim PCs. They can support most of the ergonomic scenarios that desktops can. They can also be used in portable-mode but ergonomics without accessories might not be that great. I've never seen a laptop with a built-in ErgoDox EZ for example. But laptops and cyberdecks (if they are rigid enough) can be used in <a href="https://postimg.cc/vDGTm95b">creative positions</a>.</p>
<p>Game consoles, phones, and tablets are the least ergonomic because they support few, if any, peripherals which allow for using the devices in different positions.</p>
<p>Also, new types of devices are being created every day. I think XR glasses will continue to slowly grow in popularity. Maybe in the future laptop screens won't be all that common.</p>

<p>What do you read / where do you post ?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For me personally, I don't track news very much. Instead, I browse different category pages on Microcenter, Amazon, NewEgg, etc and when I see something that looks new or different (eg. Intel Optane) I research about it and try to understand if it is meaningful.</p>
