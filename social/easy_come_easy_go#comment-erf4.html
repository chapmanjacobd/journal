<p>It’s been about 4 years since those days and they don’t stick out nearly as well as my bike trips in the Sierra Nevadas or the meals with friends tucked into a cabin. Those experiences still come from a place of wealth and privilege, but the $80 per hour kind.</p>

<p>No amount of money can fulfill one's own ego and yet the road to wisdom is through excess: one cannot know what is enough until one has had more than enough.</p>
