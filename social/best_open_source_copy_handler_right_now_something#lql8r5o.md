> millions of tiny files like Node_modules files

I would probably use rmlint if you are just looking to remove duplicates

But for merging folders I wrote a program which allows for granular control when encountering file on file and other types of path conflicts. By default it will check that the files are the same and delete the source if the target already matches the SHA-256. If no match then it will rename the existing file to X_1.ext and move the source file to the destination.

    $ library mv -h
    usage: library merge-mv SOURCE ... DEST [--simulate] [--ext EXT]
    
        By default it won't matter if source folders end with a path separator or not
    
            library merge-mv folder1  folder2/  # folder1 will be merged with folder2/
            library merge-mv folder1/ folder2/  # folder1 will be merged with folder2/
    
        --bsd mode: an ending path separator determines if each source is to be placed within or merged with the destination
    
            library merge-mv --bsd folder1/ folder2/  # folder1 will be merged with folder2/
            library merge-mv --bsd folder1  folder2/  # folder1 will be moved to folder2/folder1/
    
        --parent mode: always include the parent folder name when merging
    
            library merge-mv --parent folder1  folder2/  # folder1 will be moved to folder2/folder1/
            library merge-mv --parent folder1/ folder2/  # folder1 will be moved to folder2/folder1/
            library merge-mv --parent file1.txt folder2/ # file1 will be moved to folder2/file1_parent_folder/file1.txt    
    
    positional arguments:

    options:
      --copy (-c)                   Copy instead of move
      --modify-depth (-mD)          Trim path parts from each source
        STRING
      --sizes (-S)                  Constrain media to file sizes (uses the same syntax as fd-find)
        STRING                      -S 6           # 6 MB exactly (not likely)
                                    -S-6           # less than 6 MB
                                    -S+6           # more than 6 MB
                                    -S 6%10       # 6 MB Â±10 percent (between 5 and 7 MB)

        [action-if ...] fallback
