Casting something to another device is really a different scope of functionality from playing media locally.

You might want to look into:

- https://github.com/skorokithakis/catt
- https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/library#listen-to-online-media-on-a-chromecast-group

It should be pretty easy to write a lua script to have `mpv` call `catt` so you could cast something by pressing a shortcut key
