When you're typing in Bash, feeling confident and brash,
And you see an error flash, what will you do?

Use the dollar, make it holler,
Before the parenthesis, make it flawless.
Syntax error, no longer a terror,
'$()' is the key, to code error-free!

Unexpected symbols, causing trembles?
Remember this song, and you wonâ€™t go wrong.

Use the dollar, make it holler,
Before the parenthesis, make it flawless.
Syntax error, no longer a terror,
'$()' is the key, to code error-free!

No more bashin' when your script is crashin',
Just recall this tune, and you'll be bashin' soon.

_So when Bash says no, with an unexpected woe,
Just remember to pay the toll $ to the man inside the box, and your code will flow!_
