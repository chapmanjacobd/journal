I've done a few of these COBOL conversions for banks in Asia. The big thing to know is that a lot of the time the code to translate isn't even that difficult once you break it down piece by piece. The main thing preventing banks from moving away successfully is politics and a lot of old timers like using the old system and they don't want to learn something new so they'll complain and then a someone who golfs every week with some IBM sales guy signs up for a new mainframe in the middle of the project.
