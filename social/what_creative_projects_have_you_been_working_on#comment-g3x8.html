<p>I like how multivalent this is. It looks like an alien shooting a laser. It looks like a joker card. It looks like an aerial shot of two people dancing. It looks like the Victorian era. It looks like a spider. It looks like a dart frog. It reminds me of Star Wars Togruta. It reminds me of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sable_(video_game)">Sable</a>--but just a <em>little</em> bit.</p>
