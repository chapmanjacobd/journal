I can write TypeScript/JS but I definitely prefer backend and data processing. I've mostly used Python and R. I wrote almost all this: https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/library

I use Linux every day and I'm familiar with a lot of performance optimization and debugging tools like strace, ltrace. 

I have several years of experience writing custom spatial data processing with GDAL/OGR (using the python wrapper). I'm also pretty familiar with ffmpeg

And I'm very comfortable with PostgreSQL, BigQuery, and [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/product/what-is-dbt)
