Honestly, I would recommend picking one at random--
or if you have the time to categorize them, pick a few which are different to see what you like... the problem with that though is that they are all pretty different. 

A lot of the textures which people barely mention on this sub have been some of my favorites but the popular ones are also popular for a reason

Recently, I tried the Barracuda texture and I was surprised how much I liked it--although I may have damaged the sleeve because I left on the fleshlight warmer for 12 hours before I used it the first time so I don't know if what I felt is what comes out of the box. The picture of the texture on fleshassist looks pretty consistent but the front and the back feel very different. I don't think they designed the fleshlight warmer to be able to damage the sleeves so maybe that isn't even worth mentioning as a caveat, other than you can't really trust that how you think it will feel via the image of the sleeve will match up with how it actually feels.

I don't pay any attention to the girls on the boxes, though some orifices are sexier to see or feel
