<p>Right. That's essentially what I mean. Starve off. I wasn't thinking of multiple stages but I guess that is possible too.</p>
<p>It would make sense for such a virus to put more pressure on its host species to maximize its reproduction time but in the long-term it wouldn't make a big difference. But our technology stack is pretty brittle even on the industrial side.</p>
<p>Solar panels in environments which require little day-to-day maintenance would lose about 0.5% efficiency per year and completely stop working after a few hundred years (at most). Betavoltaics might last a few thousand years but eventually things stop working. So they definitely need to keep humans alive and happy to maximize the time the antennae can be blastin'.</p>
