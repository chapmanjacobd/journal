The reason this doesn't work is because of information entropy:

You can re-encode the videos (throw out information) to save space or delete them and download them later from somewhere else.

_Uncompressed_ video is really big and as such it is rarely ever saved to disk as uncompressed. 50 minutes of uncompressed video is 1TiB 
(24-bit, 1080p @ 60 fps: 24 × 1920 × 1080 × 60 = 2.98 Gbit/s)
