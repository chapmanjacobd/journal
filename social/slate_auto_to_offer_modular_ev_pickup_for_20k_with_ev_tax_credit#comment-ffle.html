<p>The only reason why there are so many petrol stations is that there are (or at some point <em>were</em>) so many affordable petrol cars.</p>
<p>Most people don't <em>need</em> home charging. People don't pump petrol from their home oil refinery, etc. A lot of people go to the laundromat to wash their clothes. If electricity is half the cost of petrol they are effectively getting paid to play on their phones or grocer for 30-60 minutes. The people that <em>can't afford</em> to wait will stick with petrol for their Machiavellian moral reasons anyway.</p>
<p>It is a bit of a chicken and egg problem. It would be interesting to know what share of EV use will be the breaking point where charging will be ubiquitous enough to not be a problem--but it does seem like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_car_use_by_country">most governments</a> are subsidizing or outright paying for the charging infrastructure.</p>
