Hands-on experience matters more. Certificates and tests are usually very narrow in their exposure. 

People have different motivations for learning. If getting a certificate motivates you to learn something well then I think it is a great thing regardless of what the certificate actually tested. 

If a certificate gives you confidence and leverage in a negotiation scenario I'm happy for you. But if you fail to pass a certificate I wouldn't worry too much about it either.
