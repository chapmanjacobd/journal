<p>Even if we had universal maximum income where everyone could afford a McMansion and their own private archipelago, having a job and not having one would still be a social differentiator (the same way that having a university degree is still important to people in an age where anything can be learned from anywhere via the Internet).</p>
<p>So the big boss would still do the nepotism and you'd have his nephew as a coworker. The guy who you'll need to babysit and will be promoted before you but you'll still need to tactfully dismiss his dangerous ideas (economic and human life) even though he outranks you.</p>
