It was difficult for me to follow the first time I watched it. The second time I watched it with better subtitles and skipped the long transitions between scenes that have connected ideas.

There's definitely some symbolism going on (list sorted by more important near the top): 

- themes: traditionalism / modernity, localism / globalism, the past / the future, life / death, reproduction and the edges of cycles, authenticity / imitation [mystification] (vs. unique things that happen once but simultaneously over and over again), interpretation / making things up, habitation / identity, ownership / extraterritoriality
- Holofernes (beheaded in his sleep). Someone wants to buy him but "not for sale" (modern materialism vs traditional homo sacer) then Jakub says "take it away there is no room for it here" and people shout "Jakub, go on trade!"
- anesthesia (curare), mannequins (with "pale faces flushed from the illness they die of")
- the rose preserve which is not preserve, the perishable egg ("For hatching, it's best to let Belgian hens sit on them--or you can do it yourself")
- birds of paradise, other birds
- books
  - bird book but also scripture but also advertisements for alternative medicines
  - stamp books
     - "what if we know all the landscapes that we come across in life?"
     - "remember that there is no final Mexico--behind every Mexico there is a new one"
  - Legend books, unwritten books, great epics, pallid and monotonous nameless novels, faceless giants, dark evening stories, cloudy dramas, errant and lost books...
- "beware of blind literalism--have you noticed that swallows fly between verses? Stanzas of swallows. You should learn to read from the flight of these birds."
- firemen, things which stick on chimneys (larvae: eggs, nymphs, and adults)
- biblical allegories (father and son dynamic, three wise men, seven years of plenty)

Books and birds are not just books and birds but they mean something else. I don't think there is a definite answer to a lot of the metaphors and symbolism in the film, but I don't think it is as simple as just an incomprehensible dream either. The film is an interpretable dream and dreams have multiple meanings. Dreams are rarely literal. Dreams are based on memories and feelings--attempts to aggregate and reduce the complexity of the world into something which is more compact.

There is definitely conflict between memories of the past and uncertainty of the future. Anxiety about events being too large to fit into space-time. Anxiety about the quality of time (spending a life working for other people; "Do we get fully valuable and credible time [at the sanitorium]? No. We get time used up by people. It's frayed and full of holes: vomited, secondhand time..."). The film itself is cyclical with the main character arriving and departing from the same place. I don't think it is a mistake that the drink which Jozef tries to drink is the same color as the fruit preserve (but this is a small, unimportant detail).

There are definitely some scenes, events which have no place in time, which may loosely reproduce some short story but don't really move the main plot forward. They are there for narration, continuity, and to move the _theme_ of the film forward. Perhaps everything between the two crawling under the bed scenes and between the crawling under the dinning table to when the honeymoon boat is launched and the gun is fired: 

- Jakub: "Ignorabimus"
- Military uniform guy: "Are you Jozef, Jakub's son?"
- Jakub: "Yes."
- Military uniform guy: "Did you dream the standard dream of biblical Joseph?"
- Jakub: "Maybe"
- Military uniform guy: "Did you know your dream was noticed at the highest level and was severely criticized?" 
- Jakub (smiling): "I'm not responsible for my dreams"
- Military uniform guy: "Yes, you are. You are under arrest... blah blah blah"
- Jakub (blindfolded): "blah blah blah ...that obselete dream has saved my life."

This also mirrors the first time Jakub crawls under the bed ("Are you Jozef, Jakub's son?") so I definitely think everything within these two chunks of the movie are thematically aligned with the film but not relevant to the main story. He then appears in his childhood home hugging his mother but a lot of time has passed and his mother speaks in the past tense about everything. They talk about father's death. We see dead birds. Poetic things are said and then we finally see Jakub wake up from his nap in the sanitorium. His skin looks completely different, almost dead, under the bed light. His father looks very energetic and quite healthy in contrast.

Jakub says "Life goes on" but in the same breathe notices that his watch has stopped ("I must have overwound it"). This contemporary world is completely disconnected from everything that we've seen so far in the film. His father only talks about mundane things excited to go to work. Yet in the very next scene we see his father slumped over with no energy, not doing well. And in the scene after that he is the life of the party talking about how he ate an excellent fillet of beef and mushrooms on his first day at the sanitorium. The modern world is full of inconsistency but it is also wonderful. "fillet de bef... I still feel fire in my stomach. I have diarrhea after diarrhea." We can see the inconsistency of the sanitorium (the patients are always sleeping; they are alive here but dead in their home country) but we also see the consistency of the inconsistency: the same rules apply for guests and patients.

The last text of the film is, "It's lucky that father is no longer alive. It won't affect him anymore." This cyclical narrative serves as a reminder that life, like the film itself, is both inconsistent and wondrous. The film suggests that while definite answers to its metaphors may remain elusive, the process of interpretation and exploration itself is valuable, mirroring the complexity of human experience and memory.
