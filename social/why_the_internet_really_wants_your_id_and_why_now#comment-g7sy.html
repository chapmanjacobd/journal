<p>Could we use Login.gov for this? Or something that builds on top of it? I'd rather see a government solution rather than a baker's dozen of <a href="https://www.clearme.com">CLEAR</a> copycats competing to create <em>the most invasive and thus the most accurate</em> identity verification product. There's also this weird tendency for private companies to develop unchecked systemic biases like making it easy for some races to verify automatically but all non-white people need manual verification.</p>
<p>Maybe the US could have something like</p>

<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Estonia">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Estonia</a></li>
<li>but really... Login.gov works pretty well... not sure why we need something special</li>
</ul>
