<p>I agree. So far I haven't read that they have done actually done this. Have any payments stopped? Has enough evidence been created by now to charge? What specific laws have been broken? These?</p>
<ul>
<li>Trade Secrets Act (18 U.S.C. §   1905) - prohibits federal employees from disclosing confidential business or trade information.</li>
<li>Computer Fraud &amp; Abuse Act (CFAA) (18 U.S.C. § 1030) - criminalizes unauthorized access to computers and networks, including hacking and data theft.</li>
<li>Espionage Act (18 U.S.C. §§ 793-798) - prohibits obtaining, transmittin, or leaking national defense information to harm the U.S. or aid a foreign power.</li>
<li>Wiretap Act (18 U.S.C. § 2511) - Makes it illegal to intercept, use, or disclose electronic, oral, or wire communications without authorization.</li>
<li>Economic Espionage Act (18 U.S.C. §§ 1831-1839) - Criminalizes theft or misappropriation of trade secrets, especially for foreign benefit.</li>
<li>Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA) (18 U.S.C. App 3) - Regulates how classified information is handled in court to prevent unauthorized disclosure.</li>
</ul>
<p>I haven't seen anything truly damning... just a bunch of people saying "no" and then fired the next day and replaced with loyalists...</p>
<p>I do not like what they are doing either. It is beyond disturbing. But I think we'll need hard evidence first...</p>
