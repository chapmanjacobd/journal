<p>I keep tabs open when I need to do something urgently otherwise I save them to a sqlite database. Every week I see if any cruft has stayed open and force myself to <em>get things done</em> or push them to the sqlite database.</p>
<p>Why sqlite over simple text files? The main reason is that I can add columns like page title and time_created to keep track of when pages are saved and marked as completed. But I've used simple text files for a long time too and it's easier to start with that.</p>
<p>Gmail snoozing emails to myself or adding calendar events is also helpful for one-off tasks--but for recurring tasks I run a program to open tabs from a special sqlite database that helps me keep track of all the sites that I want to visit without visiting them too frequently or forgetting one.</p>
<p>I think my number one magic trick is just to do things that are needed immediately when they are needed--even if it takes a lot longer than 5 minutes.</p>
