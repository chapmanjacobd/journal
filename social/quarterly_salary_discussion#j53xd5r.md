> Should I just put my energy into improving my SQL skills rather than branching out into other technologies?

If you feel like your SQL skills are lacking, sure! There is a lot that can be done by a database and knowing when to do a transformation in the database vs outside of it is a very important skill to have.

But at the same time, once you know how to work with a database well, it can be very demoralizing to be forced to use an ORM (but sqlalchemy is ok) or to take over and maintain another person's project where it is obvious that they have no idea what a database is. Sometimes this doesn't matter much but some applications really fit well with OLTP and it is painful to not have access to that (ACID, transactions, etc) in that in those cases
