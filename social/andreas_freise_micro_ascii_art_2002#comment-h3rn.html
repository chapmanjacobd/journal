<p>I like these very micro-scale ASCII. Often it seems like text artists make things too big! No imagination!</p>
<p>The ASCII animations are pretty interesting but familiar if you've ever seen Star Wars the ASCIIMATION. I wonder who was the first person who thought to try animating text?</p>
<p>I feel like this area is not fully explored in terms of tweaking fps or combining with other tricks? But maybe there's not much more that can be done</p>
<p>Also, the collection of 2400 or so .txt files is also pretty extensive: <a href="https://www.ascii-art.de/ascii/">https://www.ascii-art.de/ascii/</a></p>
