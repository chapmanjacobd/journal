<p>What about those hot water heaters from Thailand or China? Example: <a href="https://mazuma.co.th/en/water-heater-mazuma-mainpage-en/">https://mazuma.co.th/en/water-heater-mazuma-mainpage-en/</a></p>
<p>They are like $50~$200 USD. Instant hot water that doesn't run out. I've used them a few times. It seems kinda bizarre to me that people have these huge water tanks in their homes</p>
