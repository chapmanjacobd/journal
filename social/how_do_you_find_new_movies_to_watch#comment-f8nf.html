<p>I scraped reddit comments a while ago and made this list of about 20,000 lines. Some of these lines aren't movie <em>titles</em> but a lot are:</p>
<p><a href="https://unli.xyz/cinema.txt">https://unli.xyz/cinema.txt</a></p>
<p>I did something similar for music as well:</p>
<p><a href="https://unli.xyz/music.txt">https://unli.xyz/music.txt</a></p>
<p>Both lists are sorted randomly and I recommend sorting it randomly again to maximize our communal entropy...</p>
<p>But a lot of these films have limited distribution. <a href="https://mubi.com/en/us/showing">MUBI</a> is a good platform for curated movies.</p>
