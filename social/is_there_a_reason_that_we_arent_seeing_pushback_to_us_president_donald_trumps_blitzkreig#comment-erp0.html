<blockquote>
<p>to resign with 9 months severance</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is honestly the most enraging thing. Elon gave a severance to twitter employees and has had a class action and multiple lawsuits for not following through his severance promises. The email that was sent out was worded really weirdly and I really doubt those who reply "resign" will actually be getting 9 months of severance.</p>
