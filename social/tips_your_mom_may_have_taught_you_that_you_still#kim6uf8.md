I've read that hiccups are from excess oxygen. Anything that you can do to decrease the amount of oxygen in your body or the mixture of air that you breathe should remove hiccups: breathing into a paper bag for a couple minutes, eating a spoonful of sugar (or anything else that [binds to oxygen](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4423361/).. It would make sense that people are more prone to hiccups after eating food which is oxygen-rich), etc.
