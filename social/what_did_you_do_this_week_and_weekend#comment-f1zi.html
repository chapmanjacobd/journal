<p>I started watching <em>Mindhunter</em> and it's great!</p>
<p>Also started planning for a summer trip to visit family. My wife hasn't met any of my siblings yet and she also wants to visit Anaheim Disneyland. My wife was able to score some free tickets from her friends who work there. I was laid off in 2023 and had an "onsite" flight canceled but was able to re-use that flight credit and stretch that to buy six plane tickets for the wife and I. So as long as the US doesn't collapse before then we are both excited for summer!</p>
