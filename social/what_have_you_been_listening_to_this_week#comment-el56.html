<p>I've been enjoying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaspard_Aug%C3%A9">Gaspard Aug√©</a>'s (Justice) work released under the name <em>Musclorvision</em>: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d14tkC_v3Z8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d14tkC_v3Z8</a></p>
<p>Over the past couple of years I've done a better job of looking up <a href="https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/journal/blob/main/lists/people.musical.artists.list">the names of people</a> in <a href="https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/journal/blob/main/lists/music.bands.list">bands that I enjoy</a> and finding their solo work / other bands. It's often very rewarding!</p>
