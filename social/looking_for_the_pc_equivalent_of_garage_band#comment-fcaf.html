<p>GarageBand is a pretty unique beast. The software side is somewhat simple... the thing that makes it easy to use is that it comes with a lot of sounds out of the box!</p>
<p>There are a lot of public-domain tracks out there which you might be able to use directly or build off of. But you need to find them on your own. This can take a lot of time...</p>
<p>Public domain <em>samples</em> and <em>stems</em> (short clips of songs or individual instruments; like those provided with GarageBand) on the internet are often mis-labeled as copyright free when they really aren't. You have to be careful if your track ever blows up in popularity but otherwise you should be fine.</p>
<p>There are also many free-to-use-with-attribution tracks which you could use directly. Kevin MacLeod makes a lot of great ones! But the author might ask that you not sample from or remix them.</p>
<p>If you have the sounds that you want and are ready to assemble them together you don't need a full DAW. Maybe look at Audacity... Personally, I find video editors more intuitive than most audio editors. DaVinci Resolve is free and supports multiple audio tracks so that might work for you: <a href="https://youtu.be/IVMMFv4K0To">https://youtu.be/IVMMFv4K0To</a></p>
<p>edit: I just found this... I've never used it but let me know if it works better than Resolve if you decide to try it: <a href="https://www.audiotool.com/">https://www.audiotool.com/</a></p>
