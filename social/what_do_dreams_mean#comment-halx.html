<p>[does] a dream's content indicates anything about what problem the brain is trying to work out?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I doubt there is much correlation. The mind is mostly compressing information and re-organizing. Dreams are a byproduct of sleep but not a reason for it. I doubt there is much of a relationship between what we experience as dreams and what the brain is actively doing at a physical level.</p>
<p>I feel like dreams are either ideation separate from the purpose of sleep that we've somehow evolved into doing with the excess of nighttime processing capacity OR dreams are an emergent property of what is happening during sleep.</p>

<p>is there any study</p>

<p>I found these:</p>

<p>And here are a few that possibly contradict my view:</p>

<p>It will be exciting to see if we'll ever get concrete answers here--via neuralink, etc.</p>
