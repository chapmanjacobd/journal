How do I disable Ctrl-Delete from closing the tab? I use it often when typing and so I accidently close windows where I typed a long paragraph.

&#x200B;

it is a little annoying but doesn't happen more than a few times a week but over my life probably at least 50 times so I'd like to figure out how to prevent it from happening again
