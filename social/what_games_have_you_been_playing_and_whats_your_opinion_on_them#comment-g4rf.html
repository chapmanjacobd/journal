<p>I've been playing a lot of <em>Bartender DS</em></p>
<p>*<em>hic</em>*</p>
<p>Just kidding. But I did finally find the name of a DS game that has been eluding me:</p>
<p><em>Hotel Dusk: Room 215</em>. edit: actually, wait no. I need to do more research...</p>
<p>There are a lot of NDS and GC games that I never got around to start playing. So my goal this week is to play <em>No More Heroes</em> at least once.</p>
<p>edit2: Did you know they made a version of Carcassonne for DS?! bonkers! And Catan!</p>
