<p>Maybe that's because the status quo and centrism in general doesn't have many anchors? Right wing and left wing theory often has the air of religious text but where would liberalism go, <em>what would it become over time</em>, if the left and the right didn't exist? Without the pressure of radicalism, the core tension within liberalism--individual liberty vs. social equality--would become the new left/right axis.</p>
<p>To me liberalism feels like Jerry in <em>Rick &amp; Morty</em>. Jerry is often the only sane and consistent character. Jerry is often correct and appeals to rationality. He just wants a predictable environment where he can exist.</p>
<p>Being a centrist in the USSR has a lot of similarities between being a centrist in 1980s Canada but there are also many differences--so what distinguishes social liberals when morals are relative?</p>
