Feel free to try. I think it should work. You need `ffmpeg`

There are a few different things you could try:

1. Just run it with the instructions above and see what happens
2. Try after installing firefox

~~3. Try running with the `--chrome` flag which uses `--headless=new`. If you can't install chrome/chromium without X or wayland with default repos then maybe you will need to google how you can install it for selenium~~

You can also run it in Windows from powershell
