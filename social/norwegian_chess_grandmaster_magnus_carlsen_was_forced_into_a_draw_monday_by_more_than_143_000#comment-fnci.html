<p>It would be interesting to do this for everything like a job interview--where 150,000 people are feeding in how to respond to a subjective question which determines a culture fit...</p>
<p>I guess this has kind of been done before:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We Live In Public" was a 24/7 Internet conceptual art experiment created by Josh Harris in December 1999. With a format similar to TV's Big Brother, Harris placed tapped telephones, microphones and 32 robotic cameras in the home he shared with his girlfriend, Tanya Corrin. Viewers talked to Harris and Corrin in the site's chatroom.</p>

<p>maybe we are due for a re-run with modern technology. I'm always curious about those job interviews where people are apparently using AI to game the system... maybe this would allow for more people to be a fly on the wall for this situation</p>
