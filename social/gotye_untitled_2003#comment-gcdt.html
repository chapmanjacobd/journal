<p>Such a tease!</p>

<p>From a YouTube comment it seems to be due to licensing / copyright clearance issues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, for context, this is the last track off Wally (Gotye)'s debut album "Boardface", which has been left off streaming since its release due to clearance issues regarding the samples used. This isn't necessarily new music as some of you might think (it's over 20 years old) but to many it might as well be due to this lalbum's lack of an official release outside of CD.<br/>
Regardless, l'm happy that Wally seems to have attempted to upload the album officially and, if he does, for those that haven't, please give it a listen because it is some truly fantastic music for someone who was still in the very early stages of their music-making journey</p>
