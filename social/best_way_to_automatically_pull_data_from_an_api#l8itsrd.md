I think it was Simon Willison who popularized ["git-scraping"](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/)

GitHub embraced it and has created ["flat data"](https://githubnext.com/projects/flat-data)

The tools that GitHub put together are not bad but it doesn't need to be so complicated either. I think it makes more sense to [use the tools that you are comfortable with](https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/us_visa_statistics/blob/main/.github/workflows/immigrant.yaml)
