crf is the lever to pull to choose between file size and quality. The OP really emphasized the desire to reduce file size. Of course, crf 20 will be higher quality but it will be higher filesize. Maybe 30 is a reasonable, balanced crf--it's perfectly in the middle

As for whether preset 2 vs 4 will be worth the extra encode-time it will depend on your preferences (and to a lesser extent the specific video)
