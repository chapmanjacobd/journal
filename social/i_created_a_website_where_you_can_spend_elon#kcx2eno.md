The number of non-overlapping neighborhoods is around 2.5 million. 

The number of small towns is around 200,000. 

The number of cities is around 7,000. (If you're looking for a nice canonical dataset might I recommend [NaturalEarth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/110m-cultural-vectors/110m-populated-places/))

So it's probably more like 1.5 houses per neighborhood or 500 per city.
