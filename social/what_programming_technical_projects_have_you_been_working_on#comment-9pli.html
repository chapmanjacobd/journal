<p>Every week I add one new feature to <a href="https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/library">xklb</a>. With large archives of data I often have a curation or organization task that I want to make more automated or more efficient. Some of the weird features I've created so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sorting line-delimited files by line similarity TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency)</li>
<li>Multiple playback of video (2 to as many screens or as many concurrent videos your CPU can decode. I've gotten 300 low quality videos to play in mpv before DBUS starts throwing weird errors)</li>
<li>Actions like delete or move after playing including confirmation (y/n move/delete) in terminal or GUI</li>
<li>Interdimensional cable -- playing a few second clips of random videos</li>
<li>Music alarm clock</li>
</ul>
