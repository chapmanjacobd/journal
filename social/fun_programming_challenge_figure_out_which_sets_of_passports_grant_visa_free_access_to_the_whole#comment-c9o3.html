<p>I wrote a website that helps plan multiple passport trips: <a href="https://unli.xyz/city/honeymoon/">https://unli.xyz/city/honeymoon/</a> I wrote it to help plan honeymoons with my wife but it might also be useful for people planning conferences.</p>
<p>For people that own multiple passports I have another website which lets you choose "solo travel" in the passport-visa country filter: <a href="https://unli.xyz/city/calc/">https://unli.xyz/city/calc/</a></p>
<p>krellor answered the programming challenge aspect of this question pretty well, though you will probably want to consider how difficult it is to get a passport. If they are ordinary passports most countries require you to be present in the country for a certain length of time--and you might not live long enough:</p>
