<p>Years ago it looks like there were more options for hosting phpBB and Simple Machines Forum for small communities for free. It looks like there is perhaps still a few sites like that but as you can see the users that they attract can be rather spammy: <a href="https://www.createaforum.com/directory.php">https://www.createaforum.com/directory.php</a></p>
<p>Nowadays, it seems like Discourse is the modern forum software of choice for small communities. I agree it is disappointing to not be able to spin one up as easy as a Google Document (though... this could be legitimate forum software as well: up to 100 people can edit and comment at the same time). But I feel like Discourse's requirements for free hosting are pretty generous.</p>
<p>If you don't have an existing community, how do you expect to build one? Why would people go to your site vs another forum? It's a chicken and egg problem that few people can overcome.</p>
