<p>I stumbled upon this personal movie review website (while watching DumBeast 2009) and was totally blown away by how tidy and comprehensive it is. There's a <a href="https://www.onderhond.com/stats/onderhond">stats page</a> which shows the rating average over time so you can be sure that they take their hobby very seriously!</p>
<p>Anyway. I remain impressed.</p>
