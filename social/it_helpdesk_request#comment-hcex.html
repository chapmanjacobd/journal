<p>It's probably a 3.3v reset pin problem</p>

<p>kapton tape will be a bit safer than electric tape but do what you gotta do :-)</p>
<p>To be clear, this isn't a motherboard problem but a PSU / SATA specifications problem. You could probably swap PSUs on the machines instead of taping anything--or just use the drive from your HDD dock (which isn't sending voltage to the 3rd pin which is why it works)</p>
