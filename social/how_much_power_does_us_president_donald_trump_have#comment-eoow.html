<p>As an aside, it's weird how some sites paywall content. In my browser I see one paragraph and then a subscribe-to-newsletter CTA and then this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Youâ€™ve read your last free article. Subscribe now to keep reading. If you're already a subscriber, sign in.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, I have pretty well-developed media literacy skills so I'm familiar with the fade-into-paywall model. But if my media literacy was less developed I could easily assume that the whole article is one paragraph long! Even the text seems to suggest that the last paragraph that I read was my last free article.</p>
<p>This might seem like a stretch to some of the older generation who have gone from newspapers to iPads but it would really confuse a younger me. I might get the impression that one paragraph is all you needed to be on the front page. They really should add a bit more explanation or CSS gradients, etc</p>
