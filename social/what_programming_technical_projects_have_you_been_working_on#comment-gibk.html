<p>PostGIS is great for vector data but for images it's a lot easier to use a tile server:</p>

<li><a href="https://github.com/developmentseed/titiler">https://github.com/developmentseed/titiler</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hyperknot/openfreemap">https://github.com/hyperknot/openfreemap</a> (filesystem as server!)</li>
</ul>
<p>Just use QGIS or gdal_translate to save your images to something like Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF first</p>
<p>ALTHOUGH! I read this the other day and it seems like what you might want:</p>

<p>The idea is to use ST_GeneratePoints and ST_VoronoiPolygons. Two vector PostGIS functions to randomly build land</p>
