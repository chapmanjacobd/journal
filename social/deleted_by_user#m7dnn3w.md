As long as all the categories are clearly defined to you, I definitely prefer shallow folders. I would go with option 2. 

But there really isn't a big difference here... do you anticipate needing to add another 10 or 20 folders at the top level? In that case, you might consider two levels... but you could also make that change when you get to that point!
