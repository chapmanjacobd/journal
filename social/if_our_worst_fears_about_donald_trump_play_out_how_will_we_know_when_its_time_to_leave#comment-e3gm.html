<p>By the time you <em>know</em> that it is time to leave it will be, logistically speaking, far past the optimal time to emigrate. If you have a high degree of confidence that the worst will happen, I would leave before the new year.</p>
<p>We are certainly in for interesting times. My wife's visa was finally approved after 16 months and we just came back to the US last Monday (Nov. 4th). I seem to have poor timing... though I arrived in time to vote.</p>
<p>I feel like some of these fears are irrational. I hope I'm not wrong. I would never vote for Trump and I am sad that he won but I also feel like it's not the end of the world. I would put it at a 6.5 on the BAD-o-meter. Materially speaking, what are the changes that you fear most?</p>
<p>edit: For me, one Trump with dementia and PTSD isn't a worry. What worries me is if there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiring_and_personnel_concerns_about_Donald_Trump#Turnover">enough</a> incompetent loyalists in his cabinet to misjudge a situation and cause a tragedy.</p>
