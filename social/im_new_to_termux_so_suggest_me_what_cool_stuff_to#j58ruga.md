I think you're confusing Tasker with Termux. The Termux-tasker plugin is a free app and it is available on fdroid and GitHub but Tasker does cost money.

There is a 7-day trial version but the Tasker app on the play store is up-to-date. Unfortunately, I think the author went a bit crazy with the AutoTools suite of apps but Tasker is a solid app and it is worth the money.
