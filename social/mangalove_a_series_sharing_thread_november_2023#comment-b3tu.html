<p>Lately, I've been reading more of Jean Giraud's comics. I really enjoy the world building and art style. One of his most popular series is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Incal">The Incal</a>. It was co-created with Alejandro Jodorowsky, the same guy who directed the movie <em>The Holy Mountain</em> (1973).</p>
<p>Every panel is overflowing with imaginative detail, from the stunning cityscapes to the creative character and technology designs.</p>
