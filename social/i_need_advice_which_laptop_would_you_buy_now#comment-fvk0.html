<p>4K video editing can be very demanding depending on the codecs used. That remark is the only thing that makes me hesitate to endorse something like the Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5 as a single solution to your computing needs.</p>
<p>Linux compatibility on my "XiaoXinPro" 14 AHP9 (AMD Ryzen 7 8845H w/ Radeon 780M Graphics; 32GB 6400 MT/s; 84wh) has been pretty good. I bought it in Hong Kong last year for $828.</p>
<p>Before that, I was using a Tuxedo Pulse 15 (AMD 4800H; 91wh) and was pretty happy with that aside from the poor chassis/keyboard build quality. The chassis of the IdeaPad is definitely an upgrade from that experience but falls slightly short of the unibody MacBook Pro feeling.</p>
