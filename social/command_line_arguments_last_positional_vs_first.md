`command input1 input2 output` seems to be common: `cp`, `ln`, `mv`, `gdalwarp`

`command output input1 input2` also exists in a few tools like `ogr2ogr`... 

I adopted this output-first style into a few of my tools but now I wonder if it is a mistake and if I should change everything back to the seemingly more common last-position syntax

computer history or anecdotes welcome
