Maybe this is something you haven't thought about doing, but you could consider travel/work in low cost of living cities while you are paying off debt. Take a look at [https://travel.unli.xyz/](https://travel.unli.xyz/) to see what kind of places you could temporarily live. It's really easy to save money this way, the only hard part is finding a remote job and adjusting to the lifestyle.

Other than that I think you have a solid plan for paying off your debt. Good luck!
