> so i just let stuff auto-update and break

imho **if you have the flexibility for it** this is the way to go. If the breaking change is documented, even poorly, then you don't need to dig around. If the breaking change is undocumented then it's still easier to identify where something broke by reading the recent commits and if it's still a bug the developer will be more willing to fix it than if it is a few months or years down the line--especially for hobby projects with a small number of developers where potential security holes aren't backported.
