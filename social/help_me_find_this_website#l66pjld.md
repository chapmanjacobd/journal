yt-dlp can pull down the list of unviewable links (not sure if this includes private videos) but it definitely can get the links to deleted or geofenced videos. This obviously does not include _unlisted_ videos

I'd be surprised if the site was able to iterate over unlisted videos that except in the case that it kept track of videos which used to be public but then were made unlisted / private
