This is partly because color does not translate to black&white without parameters. Luminosity is dependent on wavelength. Additionally, film in film photography does not capture a linear "color" profile. I say "color" because this is about black and white film photography. Color just means wavelength.

This photo likely needs *some* amount of color correction as well as the American photos which were being discussed
