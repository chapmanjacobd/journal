<p>oops... it's my fault. I often listen to offline copies which sometimes have old links. I'm usually pretty good at checking if there is another with live video with similar audio to the version that I already like--or at the very least checking that the link is still valid.</p>
<p>In any case thanks for catching this and linking to the exact version!</p>
