<p>I made a little word splitting program while on my phone between rides at Hong Kong Disneyland: <a href="https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/computer/blob/main/bin/find_word_breaks.py">https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/computer/blob/main/bin/find_word_breaks.py</a></p>
<pre><code>echo -n mylifeboatisfullofeels | find_word_breaks.py
my lifeboat is full of eels
echo -n myothercarisacdr | find_word_breaks.py
my other car is a c dr
</code></pre>
<p>It's far from perfect but it made the waiting-in-line go by fast.</p>
<p>Something dynamic programming like this probably runs faster: <a href="https://github.com/christophsk/segment-string/">https://github.com/christophsk/segment-string/</a></p>
