> Not sure how or why they ended up being 187 meters

likely truncated from a geometric clipping operation as part of a program to smooth over and combine overlapping or conflicting boundaries from one or more datasets. 

It's also possible they have some data cleaning script which will limits linestrings to be 187 meters so that they don't have bad data going all across the map
