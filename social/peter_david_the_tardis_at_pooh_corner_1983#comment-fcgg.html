<p>Question #1: The "Sanders" Question...<br/>
Hello. I have a dilemma. I was discussing Winnie the Pooh with a friend the other day. (Don't ask me why, we're both grown adults). And he INSISTS that because it says "Sanders" above the door, that it is Winnie the Pooh's last name. As in Winnie the Pooh Sanders. I told him this is not true, and showed him your web page where it states "It means he had the name (Sanders) over the door in gold letters and pooh lived under it".</p>
<p>He still INSISTS that this means that is his last name. Would you PLEASE clear this up for us. We need to know which one is correct because we now have a bet riding on this. (We are very immature). Also, if it isn't his last name, why does it say Mr. Sanders over his door? That's just out of curiosity. Thank you.<br/>

<p>Winnie the Pooh Answer #1:<br/>
This has confused many people. Your friend is not alone. The answer of course is that his real name is "Winnie the Pooh" or "Winnie ther Pooh". But definitely not "Winnie the Pooh Sanders". The Sanders sign was there when he moved in. The real "Mr. Sanders" was the prior resident of the house where Pooh now lives.<br/>
