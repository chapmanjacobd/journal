> be in a different environment from where Iâ€™m studying right now

random chaotic suggestion: try UP Miagao. Your parents probably won't like it because you'll be far away but the campus is very safe and I think it's an easy place to make friends. If anything you can say you really want to go there and then compromise to go to Diliman
