<p>Which generation of Paperwhite?</p>
<p>It might not be necessary to follow all these links but they might be helpful. I'm pretty sure I just used USB (MTP) to copy files to my wife's paperwhite:</p>

</ul>
<p>It looks like MTP is compatible with OTG so as long as you have a USB cable that connects your kindle to your phone you could use something like Total Commander or MiXplorer to copy files over</p>
