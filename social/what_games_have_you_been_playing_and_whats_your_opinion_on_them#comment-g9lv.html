<p>I couldn't handle it... after the first few missions it felt numbingly repetitive. But I don't do walking sims very well. I could handle <em>The Long Dark</em> and <em>Firewatch</em> but something about <em>Death Stranding</em> just feels really tedious. I had to switch to watching the rest on YouTube and speeding up or skipping past the walking parts.</p>
