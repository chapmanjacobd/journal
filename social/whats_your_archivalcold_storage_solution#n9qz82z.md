If you have access to a SAS backplane, there are plenty of old SAS drives on eBay. I recently bought 10x 3TB drives for $30--but I think that may have been a mistake on the part of the seller. You can realistically get 3TB or 4TB disks for between $3/TB and $4/TB.

Is it _better_ than tape? Difficult to say. The drives themselves hold mechanical parts which will fail. Bitrot will happen--demagnetizism does happen... but it is less of a problem than you might immediately assume.

SAS backplanes are cheaper than tape drives and you'll likely have less of a problem buying something compatible with SAS-2 in 20 years than buying a working LTO-4 compatible tape drive (SAS-2 and LTO-4 were both released around the same time period)

Also this:

> In my experience about 40% of our tapes were unreadable after just 5 years of being kept in normal room conditions and not regularly being run through a tape drive. Also build up on the tapes meant that in order to go through our collection and save the data that was left, cleaning tapes were required far more often than normal and the drives needed to be opened up and manually cleaned several times.

> You have to bear in mind that the manufacturers claims are based on simulated aging so may not be accurate in the first place, and if your storage conditions are even slightly worse than 'optimal' it could make a huge difference.

Anecdotal yes, but LTO-4 is not even 20 years old at this point and you can find lots of stories like the above
