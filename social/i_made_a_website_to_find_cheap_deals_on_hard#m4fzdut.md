Cool site! I've seen a few other Amazon ones. I like both Amazon and eBay--I just choose whichever one has the best prices. Sometimes it is Amazon and sometimes it is eBay

But recently I wanted to buy a $28 100W USB C charger on Amazon so I sent the link to my in-laws' and on their Amazon Prime account it was only $23! 

I thought that was really weird but I think it was mostly due to different state taxes. I really dislike how prices are not tax and fee inclusive in the US. It makes it very difficult to compare things--it's becoming really common for boring hotels to tack on $35-per-night resort fees just because they have a gym room, etc.
