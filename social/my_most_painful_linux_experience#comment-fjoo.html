<p>Yeah, the <code>fstab</code> can do that. <code>systemd</code> mounts makes things a bit less chaotic. But you can also add <code>nofail,x-systemd.automount,x-systemd.device-timeout=30</code> to an fstab mount's options to essentially do the same thing that systemd mounts do</p>

<p>I've been saved by <code>ssh</code> in a lot of these cases. It might take a few hours to figure out how to <code>ssh</code> from your phone but it's definitely worth it! Tailscale makes the networking easy so you can ssh from across the room or across the world (if you don't want to be beholden to the company, there is also the OSS Headscale but it requires quite a bit more setup).</p>
