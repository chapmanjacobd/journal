> What happens if I'm laid off? What do I have to show on my CV

I have a bunch of projects on my CV but it doesn't really help. I've been unemployed for almost a year. 

I would focus first on appreciating what you have and learning to enjoy life. It sounds like you are well on your way by establishing healthy work-life balance boundaries.

If you are stressed about potential layoffs, focus on building relationships. Networking and human connections are what keep you in the job market.
