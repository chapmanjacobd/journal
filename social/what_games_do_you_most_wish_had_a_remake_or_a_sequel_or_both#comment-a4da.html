<p>Custom Robo, really crush it with newer hardware</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree that this series needs a continuation. There have actually been a few games since the 2000~2004 era. The most well known is Synaptic Drive (2020) but, despite being made by some of the original people as Custom Robo, there is no story mode and so the raison d'etre is missing so it feels a bit soulless. There's also Hyper Jam (2019) which some people online are comparing to Synaptic Drive.</p>
<p>It's not enough to update the graphics and crush it on better hardware. Reasons why Custom Robo is still a great game:</p>
<ul>
<li>The game is calm despite being about destruction.</li>
<li>Levels are challenging but not stressful. Simple but still interesting.</li>
<li>Each customization option feels unique without any specific combination being overpowered. You need to use strategy and each customization option create different affordances for strategy.</li>
<li>Story and music are engaging without being distracting.</li>
</ul>
