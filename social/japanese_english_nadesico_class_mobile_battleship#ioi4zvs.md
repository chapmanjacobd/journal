interesting! I thought it would be more funny. I guess the "However, damage from combat was excluded" is kind of funny (because it is a damage report that the characters look at to assess the post-combat damage)

And I think there might be a joke in "proportion/ratio of damage" but I won't think about it too hard \^^
