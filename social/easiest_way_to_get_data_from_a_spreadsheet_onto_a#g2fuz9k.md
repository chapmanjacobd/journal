yeah if it is small data then I would just use Google Sheets tbh. I only use elm because my data is like 20GB so I have to pull it in depending on what city people are looking at. The data file you saw is probably the 1 row temp file that I use so the types are correct.

If you can think of some interesting graphs then it might be worth it to use elm but if you can make those graphs in Google Sheets then I would just link to a special public -view Google Sheet
