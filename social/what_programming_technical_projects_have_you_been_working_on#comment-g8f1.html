<p>This looks like a neat idea! I'm not an ideal first user but I would be interested in semi-regular updates here with your learnings and progress at least every few months--especially in the spirit of "What's interesting about it? Are you having trouble with anything?"; don't be afraid to dig into the technical aspects! I would think it's okay to link to a devlog but you may consider including an interesting or discuss-able snippet here</p>
