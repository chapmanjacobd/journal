<p>Just a simple page full of animated gifs being animated across the screen. The source code features Arsenals and Rocketlaunchers but fret not! There is nothing scary here. No transactions. No commerce. No reciprocity. No vapid commercial fraternization. Just very constructive things happening on this site. Yes sir. Lots of construction. Endless construction. 939 gifs when one assumes none will lead to the dreaded Client Error: 404. Yes, Client not Server. It's your fault that they don't exist--not the Server's.</p>
<p>I choose to interpret the jumpiness across the screen as an artifact of all the pneumatic hammers going on inside the page rather than any mistake on the part of the artist whose personal PPE equipment protects against <code>requestAnimationFrame</code>.</p>
<p>If <code>setInterval 100</code> was good enough for Ã‰mile Cohl it will be good enough for you!</p>
