<p>Doesn't this already happen though? If you buy something then someone somewhere has your address. Maybe not everyone uses eBay, maybe not everyone uses PayPal... but how does my address go into a database after mandatory ID legislation goes into effect? Does <em>every</em> website know my address? Is it a single private company that holds the monopoly on ID verification? If not, it will it be fractured and incomplete like it is already and I don't see how additional verification will solve this problem.</p>
<p>Also, if you've ever paid for ads on sites like Facebook or Google Ads, you can already target a very small area. The smallest radius you can target in Google Ads is 1 kilometer (or approximately 0.62 miles). They could <em>already</em> do even smaller but they don't allow you to purchase ads too targeted for privacy reasons. With Facebook, 1 mile radius and a minimum of 20 people within that radius (based on additional filtering).</p>
<p>The platforms that deliver advertisements to non-logged in users already have a pretty good idea where you are (even WHO you likely are--supercookies help but are not required for profiling) <em>and even more importantly</em> part of their revenue plan accounts for a certain degree of poor targeting. The fact that there is <em>some uncertainty</em> prevents you as a company from giving up after you <em>know</em> that all 3,000 potential customers of your niche local product have seen your ad but aren't all that interested. The uncertainty factor makes you want to spend more, not less.</p>
