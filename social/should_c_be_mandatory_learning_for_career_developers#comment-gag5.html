<p>Yeah, I'm more in the is <em>not strictly necessary</em> camp.</p>
<p>People are okay with specialists building specific car parts without needing to deeply know how all the other parts work.</p>
<p>Knowing computers <em>deeply</em> takes about as much time as knowing how each car part is made and how to make useful incremental improvements to each car part. There's a lot going on in every level. Both in cars and in computers.</p>
<p>If anything, it's a problem that there are too many generalists. But this is just as much a consequence of industry practices of tech vs manufacturing as it is of individual choice.</p>
<p>That's not to say that specializing deeply in two different areas is not fruitful for cross-pollination... but not everyone needs to know C. It's like saying everyone needs to know how to build a combustion engine--even the air conditioner person.</p>
