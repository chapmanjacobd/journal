<p>Aside from actual runway, I wonder if it is true that startups have more security--even if you are the CEO. Startups follow trends just like any other company. If layoffs are vogue then some aspiring middle manager might try the old <em>outsourcing to Croatia</em> trick. Maybe he even knows that it isn't going to work but he does it anyway out of spite because you didn't make a good first impression to him.</p>
<p>Job security at large companies is illusory too: the company might have lots of revenue but they might have equally high costs. Especially fixed resources which might be inflexible to adaptation: a factory that can efficiently push out <em>dadoods</em> but not doodads. The company might be incapable of recognizing the changing market or be too committed to the strategy that worked for the last twenty years. Or maybe the new leadership team are all McKinsey alumni and they know how to gut the company to the ground in less time than you can say <em>startup</em>.</p>
