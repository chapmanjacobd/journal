<p>I'm sympathetic to the current loneliness epidemic meta-trend but I'd also like to remind people that religion is communal when it has a monopoly on attention. When there are competing sects religion becomes divisive and thus the north side of town doesn't talk as much to the south side of town--or even taking into account strange aspects of organized religion where you could find the case study of Spring City, UT:</p>
<p>Most of the population are Mormon and everything is all communal but then the church HQ decides that the town needs another chapel so they decide to split the town with arbitrary lines. Suddenly, you are not talking to your neighbors (who live just across the street!) as much--even though you belong to the same sect--you are "required" to go to different chapels. This decision for this comes from hundreds, maybe thousands of miles away. It disrupts the natural spatially auto-correlated geographical schemata of human mingling.</p>
<p>I will get back to the point that I initially set out to make: religion (ostensibly) forces people to get out of their bubble and interact with people that they might not have a reason to otherwise--increasing the velocity of socialization. But this only really works well when every one is forced to do it--otherwise it may as well be Gold's Gym where people who like religion are doing religion. The extra socialization factor in this case is zero. That's not to say that it isn't creating a community--just that it may as well be a bar or anything else. It doesn't have to be a chapel.</p>
