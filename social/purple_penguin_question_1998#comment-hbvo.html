<p>I feel like I've shared this before or maybe I've just been listening to it a lot recently</p>
<p>If you only listen to one song from this... listen to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFjWQ9XlSc&amp;t=2390s">Diamond</a>. It's really a perfect song I think... I recently added it to my <a href="https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/journal/blob/main/lists/music.songs.list">all time perfect songs list</a></p>
