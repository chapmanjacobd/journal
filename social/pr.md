What I'm looking for in my next job:

I like working on Python data engineering and transactional database workflows

I work best when I have large blocks of time to focus

My ideal job would be flexible across timezones
What I'll bring to the team:

I like simplifying complex processes and making them more reliable and more relevant to individual needs. All useful computer programs take some data and output some data. Life doesn't need to be more complicated than that. I'm not an expert in algorithms but I realize that almost every algorithm has already been written.

The hard part of programming has already been done a thousand times over by people with PhDs. The value that I bring to the table is knowing which parts should be glued together and which parts can be made redundant.
What I've recently accomplished:

In my free time I write scripts to manage large libraries of media (>100TiB).
