<p>I think this is mostly fine. It seems like her purpose for using a penname is mostly <a href="https://seanan-mcguire.livejournal.com/133700.html">market segmentation</a>.</p>
<p>To filter out children's books it seems like you could choose <a href="https://abooklike.foo/escape?q=kZRA9r,jqZr4&amp;fnf=a&amp;pop=c&amp;period=a">Acclaimed</a> instead of the default "Special Blend"--but they should have more options for filtering out books by intended audience/reading level, shouldn't they?</p>
<p>edit: also, I notice that the site is somewhat limited. It seems to return a lot of the same books for different types of queries. But if you restrict by a specific published decade like 2000-2010 there is much more variation.</p>
