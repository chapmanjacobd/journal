<p>If the atom bomb was not public knowledge it would seem like a more unbelievable conspiracy theory. I think we would have roughly the same level of deterrence and effective countermeasures if that weapon was still a secret shared only among government agencies.</p>
<p>It's very possible that a sonic weapon of some kind exists. It's not outside the realm of possibility that it existed before we figured out how to split the atom. There are also good reasons for denying knowledge of any weapon for both US and Russian governments.</p>
<p>It's also very possible that it doesn't exist but that what started as a psychological break has turned certain departments across the globe into a prototyping frenzy--or that they have thought about it but because guns and poison darts exist they have not put much forethought into actually developing it.</p>
<p>But war is best fought at the psychological and morale levels--perhaps this is all propaganda perpetuated by specific or non-specific countries for various purposes.</p>
