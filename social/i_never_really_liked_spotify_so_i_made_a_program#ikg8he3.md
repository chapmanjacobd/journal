yeah you can use `catt` directly if you know the exact media you want to play. `xklb` builds on top of `catt` so you can scan all your music folders (or even youtube playlists) and then play them to speaker groups. You'll need to know the exact name of the speaker group you want to play on though.... But if you do `lt -cast -cast-to "House speakers"` without any additional constraints then it will decide what to play for you. To make it more random you could also do `lt -cast -cast-to "House speakers" --sort random`
