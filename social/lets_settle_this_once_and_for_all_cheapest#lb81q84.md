Laos has a wide variety of prices.

I would say:

1. Indonesia, Vietnam, and Cambodia (cheapest; expensive areas are limited to only a couple areas)
2. Malaysia, Laos, and Burma
3. Thailand, Philippines, and Mainland China (but some areas same prices as HK)
4. Taiwan (and South Korea)
5. Singapore, and Macau (and Japan)
6. HK

That being said you can find a $2 or $3 meal in most of these places. It really depends what you choose to eat and where you choose to stay.

In the cheapest category, the difference in prices between tourist areas and normal prices might be between 10x to 100x what locals would pay; but in more expensive places like HK, the difference between local prices and tourist prices are much closer to 1x, rarely exceeding 2x what locals would pay.

Japan is a very good value option right now if you're coming from a currency that is stronger.
