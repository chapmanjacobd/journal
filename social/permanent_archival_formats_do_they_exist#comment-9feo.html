<p>All information <em>eventually</em> gives way to entropy.</p>
<p>The only real solution is constant refresh, validation, and multiple copies of data. The only reason we know about many historical things is due to multiple copies of organisms existing and we are able to find the lucky ones that were preserved in tree sap.</p>
<p>Likewise, we are lucky to find old stories because they were passed down through constant rehearsal in oral tradition and/or because some crazy guy brought some scrolls up to a mountain. There are probably many scrolls that we don't know about because they weathered away. We just find the lucky ones. It's chance.</p>
<p>Analog may last longer than digital data but I wouldn't trust just one type of storage. If you care about something you need to have multiple copies and validate that the data is still readable every year or at the very least 5-10 years. If (VHS) players are no longer manufactured you also need to consider that aspect as well.</p>
<p>Even stone tablets have bitrot at a timescale of months if the conditions are right</p>
