In 20, 30, or 50 years I think we'll view plastics (at least in the kitchen) in the same way that we now view cigarettes or radium watches. 

The most unfortunate thing about all this is that we DO have materials which are better and more compost-able than plastic, they don't even cost more. But the cost of switching to something better happens one factory at a time.
