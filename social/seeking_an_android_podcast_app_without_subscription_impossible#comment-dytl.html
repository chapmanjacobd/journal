<p>I got used to using <code>yt-dlp</code> for everything when building on <a href="https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/library">a wrapper</a> for it. And then one day I discovered it could be used for podcasts and other sources too.</p>
<p>Because I was already familiar with yt-dlp and it was already working for me so I've never really investigated podcast apps specifically. The audio files are available locally on the phone and they auto-resume fine. The only issue I've had is when Google Podcasts closed and I had to swap out a few links with other sources.</p>
