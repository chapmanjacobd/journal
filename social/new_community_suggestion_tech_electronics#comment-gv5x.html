<p><a class="link-group" href="/~engineering.electronics">~engineering.electronics</a> is quite a bit more clear. <a class="link-group" href="/~tech.electronics">~tech.electronics</a> might be interpreted as consumer electronics like TVs and dish washers</p>
<p>I think you could just post to <a class="link-group" href="/~engineering">~engineering</a> and tag with electronics (or electrical for electrical work)</p>

<p>Prior art which might be helpful:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a new group is to be justified, its topic must already be under discussion somewhere in existing Usenet groups. The question is: under what circumstances is a new group warranted?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If the topic is consistently dominating discussion in a more general group (e.g. 80% of discussion in alt.books.horror is about one author). Forming a new group because of this reason is called "splitting". If you want to form a newsgroup by splitting from an existing group, you should discuss the idea of a new group in the existing group before coming to alt.config with a proposal. People have to agree that there is a logical way to split the discussion. The old and new group would both be need to be viable after the split.</p>
<p>Make sure the people contributing to the existing group will be happy moving to a new group. Put the findings of your discussion within the group in your proposal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The topic is being discussed in many different groups (and is being cross-posted to those groups) because people can't decide which group is most suitable. (e.g. a game is discussed in several different newsgroups). Forming a new group because of this reason is called "consolidating". You must be able to come to alt.config with numerical evidence that there is enough relevant discussion already happening in existing groups to warrant the new group. More on this later.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: you cannot claim that you need a new group because there is no place on Usenet to discuss your topic. If that were true, no-one would be posting to Usenet on that topic, therefore there is no justification for creating the group!</p>
