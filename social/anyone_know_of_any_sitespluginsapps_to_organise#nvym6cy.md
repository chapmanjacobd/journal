Yes. The first option gets the individual video fields like video title, uploader, duration, and the video URL from a playlist URL (could be an actual playlist or a pseudo-playlist like a channel URL, or the videos tab, etc. They are all considered playlists in the world of yt-dlp).

The second option does the same thing but it might be overwhelming and you can get pretty far with just using CSV files (the first option).

There might be a GUI option which does something similar (maybe Tartube, TubeArchivist, or Pinchflat?? I'm not sure)--but if you can make the command line comfortable it's usually worth the effort in getting started.
