<p>edit: I misread <em>newer</em> as older in your title but a lot of my advice still applies:</p>
<p>I enjoy the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkkiai4nXBVL8CqfMQk4KMtKibKJUfBwZ">Chzo Mythos</a> series. It has its own <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChzoMythos">TV Tropes page</a> so I suppose it is not too obscure.</p>
<p>In hopes of finding an uncommon DS game yesterday I went through the full list of physical DS cartridge games <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nintendo_DS_games_(Q%E2%80%93Z)">spread across multiple</a> Wikipedia pages. There are similar game databases as well like <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/attributes/attribute/554/">MobyGames</a>. A good way to find something obscure is to get a list of as many titles as you can then deduplicate it and exclude the popular titles. I found quite a few unusual games yesterday by doing just this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Itadaki Street</li>
<li>Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars</li>
<li>Culdcept Revolt</li>
<li>Fantasy Life</li>
<li>Civilization Revolution</li>
<li>Gunpey</li>
<li>Dokapon Journey</li>
<li>Hotel Giant</li>
<li>Flower, Sun, and Rain</li>
<li>Rooms: The Main Building</li>
<li>Nodame Cantabile</li>
<li>Chibi-Robo</li>
<li>The Settlers</li>
<li>Project Hacker: Kakusei</li>
<li>Mori no Cafeteria</li>
<li>Gardening Mama</li>
</ul>
<p>I haven't played any of these but out of the 3000+ DS games list these seemed interesting and I hadn't heard of them prior to this!</p>
<p>Of course there's also super indie and homebrew games which you could construct a similar list by scraping itch.io and GitHub.</p>
