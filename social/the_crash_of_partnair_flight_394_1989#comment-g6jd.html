<p>I like how it shows how fairly innocuous lapses in integrity add up over time. The Swiss cheese model of safety makes flying very safe but it also allows people to get used to doing strange things like flying with only one main AC generator.</p>
<p>However, most airplane crashes are like that, right?</p>

<p>The reason this was chosen is because I use a <a href="https://tildes.net/~tech/1piw/communal_answering_machine_please_leave_a_message_after_the_beep#comment-g5j1">weird program</a> to choose articles to read and it prioritizes unusual words. <em>Riven</em> (in this article's title) and <a href="https://admiralcloudberg.medium.com/neither-money-nor-manpower-the-story-of-the-de-havilland-comet-and-the-crash-of-boac-flight-781-36db2a3435ce"><em>de Havilland</em></a> (or maybe <em>BOAC</em>) are pretty rare words so that might be why I read them today.</p>
<p>(Interestingly, both articles are related to metal fatigue in some way... though that's not too uncommon...)</p>
