> how do you ascertain which ones are most worthwhile, when you can't know what the wisdom to be gained is?

I've downloaded more memes, music, amd video than I could ever read, listen to, or watch in a lifetime. So this question is one that I'm actively researching.

So far, one strategy that has helped is to sort things in different ways. I track metadata of everything so it only takes a few seconds to search or sort everything in different ways:

1. Using AI to caption images or annotate audio and then cluster related media together.
2. Write off categories of things. Narrow your scope. For example, you could believe that most short-term news is worthless. But it's often difficult to know when minor historical events signal major footnotes in history. Part of this is that history is biased and privileged. It's not worth keeping up to date with news. It requires too much emotional labor. You can make similar judgments for other categories of things that you've found less worthwhile. This saves a lot of time.
3. Group by source and evaluate previous media. Block sources that you've found to be lower quality. If you mostly read webpages you could use something like [uBlacklist](https://github.com/iorate/ublacklist). For media consumption, I wrote my own scripts to keep track of deleted files and then I do a SQL group by to see what musicians or accounts I have deleted more often. I've published that script as the "bigdirs" [subcommand](https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/library#filesystem-database-subcommands).
