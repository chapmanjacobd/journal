If it will take you more than a semester of additional schooling to change majors I'd say just stick with what you planned before

but this needs to be solely your own decision. If you want to pursue additional education in Information that's totally possible with an Psychology degree, but if you don't think you know enough about Information to decide if it's actually something that you want to pursue then maybe switching to an Information degree is better
