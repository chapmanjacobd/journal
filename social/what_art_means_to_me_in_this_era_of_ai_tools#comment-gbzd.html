<p>This article from April synthesizes a lot of thoughts that I've heard online and in the real world. Here's one quote quoted within the article that really resonated with me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What I am not happy to outsource is most of the things that AI is desperate for me to outsource. I do not want a computer to summarise texts sent by my friends into shorter sentences, as though the work of being updated on the lives of those I love is somehow strenuous or not what being alive is all about. I do not want Google’s AI feature to summarise my search into a pithy (often incorrect) paragraph, rather than reading the investigative work of my fellow humans. I don’t want AI to clean up the pictures that I take on my phone that are rich and strange in their messiness.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Simply put: I don’t know where this endless march of shortening the act of living leads us to. AI promises to free up time. But if what it spares us from is learning from our friends, writing, painting and exploring the world, then what, actually, are we meant to do with that time?</p>

<p>Ack! I <a href="https://winther.sysctl.dk/about/">just noticed</a> this author is also a tildes user. <a class="link-user" href="/user/winther">@winther</a> you sly dog you've convinced me twice to watch more <em>Michael Haneke</em>: once through Tildes and once through your <a href="https://winther.sysctl.dk/bookmarks/">bookmarks</a> page! I feel like I'm in a "temporal pincer". I landed up on your site from the <a href="https://aboutideasnow.com/">about/ideas/now</a> microblog index.</p>
