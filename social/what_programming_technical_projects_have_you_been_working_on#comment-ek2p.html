<p>My diskprices-on-eBay site was fairly successful (made $80 over the last 30 days!)--there's still a bit of maintenance work to be done to continue to improve it but I'm also thinking of <a href="https://longform.asmartbear.com/predict-the-future/#hedged-bets">what to do next</a>. Some things that passed through my mind were iPad covers / charging cables (actually, these were the wife's ideas--a site that makes it easy to find compatible things), LEGO sets, luxury bags, and real estate.</p>
<p>There are already quite a number of websites to compare LEGO sets to insanely detailed levels (rebrickable, yottabrick, but also quite a few more!) and my wife pointed out that luxury bags have more complicated methods of appraisal and valuation.</p>
<p>So I'm leaning more towards the real estate idea because I'm also interested in that and I need an excuse to help me finish up a relative poverty index idea that I've been sitting on for a while--more on that next week!</p>
