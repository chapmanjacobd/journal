<p>At <a href="http://www.mta.me">www.mta.me</a>, Conductor turns the New York subway system into an interactive string instrument. Using the MTA's actual subway schedule, the piece begins in realtime by spawning trains which departed in the last minute, then continues accelerating through a 24 hour loop. The visuals are based on Massimo Vignelli's 1972 diagram. (More info at this blog post.)</p>
<p>In its first week of launch, mta.me was picked up by The Wall Street Journal, The Huffington Post, Engadget, Gizmodo, Mashable, Creativity, Fast Company, Gawker, Wired, and more. Sound samples by Tim Kahn (Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License).</p>
