If you haven't heard of it I highly recommend Termux on Android. I didn't try it until recently -- or invest the time to get set up. but it does 70% of the things that I want--and it's available now while PinePhone software is still playing catch-up with Android. Maybe in another few years PinePhone et al will be polished enough for me to switch over but until then [I have this](https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/phone)
