If browsers supported reading SQLITE files that might be pretty cool. What if instead of 2MiB of JavaScript per page we had 500KiB of markdown inside of a SQLITE file and people could download your whole blog and read it offline?

I built a webapp with AlaSQL which is a frontend interface that feels sort-of like SQLITE even though the backend is LocalStorage/IndexedDB. If the browser had _actual_ SQLITE capability it would've been a lot easier to do and definitely more reliable with fewer edge-cases. Still, AlaSQL is an interesting platform to look into:
