<p>I've been playing <strong>Lego Horizon Adventures</strong> with the wife and it's been <em>okay</em> so far. It definitely feels like a baby's toy. You mostly walk around and point at stuff with your hands.</p>
<p>I think this video review is pretty thorough and I share many of the same thoughts: <a href="https://youtu.be/x7-Dc8p9u1s">https://youtu.be/x7-Dc8p9u1s</a></p>
<p>The game is trying to do too many things at once. It seems like there's less brick-building compared to the Lego Star Wars games I guess because they're trying to preserve a lot of the game mechanics from Horizon Zero Dawn but they don't want to overwhelm the player with too many interaction points. Overall, it's an interesting experience but the lack of open-world really takes away a lot of the mystique...</p>
