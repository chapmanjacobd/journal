<p>All quantum computation can be simulated on a classical computer--it's just very slow. 30 qubits is roughly equivalent to one billion complex numbers (which can be stored in double precision in 16 GB of RAM or so--but just storing those numbers isn't very useful; I only mention this because it is fun to think about). If you need more than 30 qubits though--things exponentially become a lot more difficult.</p>
<p>I have doubts about whether quantum hardware will ever be truly ubiquitous but if it becomes easier than classical computing then I'm sure we could write the same types of programs that we have today using qubits rather than bits as the underlying unit. The reason that probably won't happen is that some algorithms are faster with simple maths and others are faster with quantum maths.</p>
<p>But one thing to mention is that if quantum computers are somewhat ubiquitous--we'll probably all have quantum co-processors if only to have quantum encryption/communication.</p>
