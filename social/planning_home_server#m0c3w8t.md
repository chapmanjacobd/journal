I quite like this [SuperMicro 24 Bay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/175945642892). The Server Store also has a [configurable listing](https://www.ebay.com/itm/176547574313) (or [on their site](https://www.theserverstore.com/supermicro-superstorage-6028r-e1cr24n-2u-server) with more options but more expensive) if you don't like the E5-2620v3 and [a 128GB black friday](https://www.theserverstore.com/black-friday-special-7.html) build.

There are also a few well-priced P570F / R730XD on ebay if you want 24x 2.5" instead or only want 12 3.5" bays: https://labgopher.com/
