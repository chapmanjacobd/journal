<p>If we suddenly had 10% the number of humans on the planet (with rural and city areas receiving the same percentile-cull) it is still very possible that the environmental impact is largely unchanged. It only takes a small number of humans to deforest the amazon or create a chernobyl, etc.</p>
<p>Would we have less of a <em>need</em> to run the resources dry? Physically yes. But psychologically there will always be people and corporations that want to capture the market via false scarcity or drain the mangroves to build a casino that can only be accessed by aero-shuttle because it was marginally cheaper than the ecological alternative.</p>
