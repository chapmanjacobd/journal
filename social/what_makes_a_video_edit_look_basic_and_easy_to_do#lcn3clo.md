I would decrease the contrast on some of those shots but **the editing is fine**. If anything, it seems too busy.

Some of the compositing seems off-centered but this is a stylistic choice and not something that can be objectively wrong unless the mood that you creating does not match your objective. Maybe review this: https://www.muddycolors.com/2021/04/15-types-of-composition/

Not sure, why those people say it looks "basic". It's probably office politics and they are dismissing your work for social hierarchy reasons
