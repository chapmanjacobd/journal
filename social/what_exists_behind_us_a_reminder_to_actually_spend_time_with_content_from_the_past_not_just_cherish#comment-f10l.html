<p>(I disregard the bit about exact copies of media because I don't think the distinction is really all that useful, at least for this discussion, especially digital copies... that's not what I am getting at here... makes more sense to argue about that in a digital vs analog or theatre vs cinema context...)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're both rich in media and destitute in art because there are around seven billion of us and counting, continually experiencing new moments, and each of those moments experienced is an opportunity to both create and consume art.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a beautiful sentiment and I can understand this point of view.</p>
<p>You make the distinction between media and art which I haven't seen before. Maybe it comes from academia? I will ruminate on it for a bit.</p>
<p>If art is communication then we should have even more art than media...? You could imagine that a ratio exists: at the minimum, there is at least one viewer for each of the crew that creates media: the cast/crew themselves. It's not hard to imagine that at least their one or two of their family members also is affected by this created media. Beyond this... I know indie productions often struggle gaining traction. and, in the same moment, millions of people are watching <em>the hero's journey</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_film_sequels_by_box-office_performance#Relative_improvement">over and over</a>.</p>
<p>I have to wonder how much communication is actually happening there. And maybe that is the point? I think a lot of people are scared of real communication. They don't like arthouse because it asks too much of them. It asks them questions that they are uncomfortable thinking about. Most pushed films (studios essentially force local cinemas to show them) are asking the same questions over and over with the same predictable answers. These films ask you a question and tell you the answer. These media are largely substitutes: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understudy">alternatives</a> which have the same script just with different settings and character names. The effect of these media on the world is largely limited to appending a few words to already very long TV Tropes pages.</p>
<p>Casting has its own mythology and science but largely the difference in performance between actors should only affect the media's <em>conversion</em> (attractiveness and immersion; ie. we give confident and attractive people more benefit of the doubt. Verisimilitude! Verfremdungseffekt!). While the text is what makes Romeo + Juliet (1996) different from... you know... (<strong>the</strong> /s) <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>.</p>
<p>I suppose I should state my claims more clearly. I don't think that say, <em>the Bible</em>, is the only book that you will ever need and that it contains the seeds for every story you will ever hear. But... there are over 300,000 movies in this beautiful world. There are plenty of <em>duplicates</em>. Especially the ones that are made by capitalism for capitalism.</p>
<p>There is diminishing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_utility#Law_of_diminishing_marginal_utility">marginal utility</a> in seeing all <em>seven</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Age_(franchise)">Ice Age</a> films. Or watching the same play over and over. Though both these things may induce a comfortable feeling that is found in repetitive religious worship. Perhaps this is also the main appeal of content that never diverges from the same well-known questions.</p>
<p>My complaint is not limited to sequels and prequels. The whole industry is built upon reproducing, largely, the same things that it has since the 1980s. I think this is easier to describe by defining what it is not. For that I will borrow some insights from economics: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementary_good">complementary goods</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementary_good">Complements</a> stand in contrast to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_good">substitutes</a>. There are other types of goods but largely things are either complements or substitutes. When curators are building out a collection, for example the Criterion Collection, they will compare media and choose one over the other via comparative analysis and also vibes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All we ask is that each film in the collection be an exemplary film <em>of its kind</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.criterion.com/faq">https://www.criterion.com/faq</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The positioning of media within a selected collection make the differences between media stand out more. Contrast. When substitutes are grouped together things just kind of blend together. But when you alternate between each <em>Ice Age</em> film and the <em>Lord of the Rings: Extended Edition</em> films it is a different experience than watching just <em>Ice Age</em> or just <em>Lord of the Rings</em>. The <em>style</em> of the conflicting genres should make each <em>individual</em> film stand out more.</p>
<p>Do we really need <em>Ice Age 5</em>? Certainly, the first <em>Ice Age 1</em> is the most memorable. Why not alternate between <em>Lord of the Rings: Extended Edition</em> and <em>Ice Age 1</em> over and over? I can imagine that the experience might not be that much different. What is the marginal loss of this experience over the above? Is there <strong>really</strong> a loss or <em>divergence</em> in communication? I'm not fully convinced either way but I think these are the types of interesting questions that we could ask to try to determine how replaceable different media is:</p>
<p>What is the outcome of the art on the person and how does it differ from their exposure of <em>Exhibit A</em> over Art  <em>Exhibit B</em>? To what extent does the person's <a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/the-impact-of-running-people-on-computers">brain synapses differ</a> and does the difference even matter?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>with a combination of depth and accessibility that's almost totally unmatched</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Certainly, I'll give you <em>Othello</em>. I'll give you <em>King Lear</em>. I'll give you X, Y and Z... but there is more content in the world than one person can ever consume. At what point is content equivalent to the lived experience of the person after they have experienced it?</p>
<p>Even if I didn't agree with the <em><a href="https://youtu.be/dLfsCXVIvj0?t=731">Illusio</a></em> selected and reproduced by the rear-garde: what writers read, the superiority of the auteur, and the refined taste of the curator... this is itself <em>selection</em>: a collection which almost always includes a variety of media (complements) rather than media which is centered on a specific group of substitutes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each piece of art is unique to the context of its creation and to the context of its consumption, and thus carries different meanings, communicates different things, at each experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is it art or media? I think as humans there are very real limitations to the subtleties... not just in how we consume words and media but also the time-constraints to learn those webs-of-meaning and context that we would need to fully appreciate the media before we consume such media.</p>
<p>Bifurcation of a concept is the most clear split in meaning. This is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory#Quantities_of_information">information theory</a>. Yes or no is the smallest unit of meaning that can be clearly deciphered from media. Anything can be encoded into a yes and no question as long as the question is long enough and specific enough. "It depends" only occurs when questions aren't specific enough or there isn't enough context to answer concretely.</p>
<p>Multivalent media applies equally here. It is still categorizable, eclipsable/substitutable, and complementable as other media. <em>But it is more complex</em> and thus less likely to be easily categorized, eclipsed/substituted, or complemented. It's like pairing a wine and cheese. More complex flavors are less likely to suddenly appear in nature. But media is still media.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether you think it is possible for media to substitute other media, people are doing it every day when they choose to read the <em>Quran</em> over the <em>Bible</em>. When they watch <em>Elmo's World</em> over <em>Rechov Sumsum</em>. etc. They are substituting media by selecting it. Maybe they don't substitute it well but--one of these things is not like the other--people usually choose <em>between</em> substitutes: complements are excluded by default because they are different categories of choices to be made at a later time.</p>
