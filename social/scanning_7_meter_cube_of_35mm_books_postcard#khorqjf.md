This will take time. I recommend setting a very small goal (~10 mins) to accomplish *every day*. 10 minutes adds up. After a year it is about a week of "work" time.

Spend a weekend organizing similar things together (and grouping duplicates) as best you can. Then start with the smallest piles of things. If an item seems low importance put it in the "do-later" bucket. If you ever run out of time you can toss that stuff easily. If a book is already available online then you can easily put it in that bucket.

The **Genius Scan** app is quite good. But it may take a few sessions to use it efficiently.
