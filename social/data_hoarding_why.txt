My relationship with data has always been a bit complicated. My parents turn off "the internet" every night. It might be because he believes that the WiFi signals cause cancer. I'm not exactly sure.
Personally, there have been few instances where I will pay for mobile data, even when traveling. My reason is mostly driven by cost--after all if I'm the product as ads rule the mobile experience, why should I pay to be advertised to?
In Thailand, it was difficult to say no to $4 for 1 month of 100GB mobile internet. Why was the experience in the United States so much more expensive?

I'm thankful for my patient wife--to put up with all of these learned behaviors--shenanigans. Though I made sure to find an affordable unlimited data mobile plan for her shortly after she arrived to the United States. But she also thought it was ridiculous to turn off or on the internet.
