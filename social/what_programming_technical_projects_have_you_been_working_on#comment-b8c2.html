<p>Yeah I really like PostgreSQL, PostGIS. But it makes my program more difficult to install for other people. Python comes with SQLITE support out of the box. I wish there was a static build of pg built into python or something, even if that was limited to something like module-level database namespaces.</p>
<p>Right now I can easily install the same python package on my phone and everything* works great but switching to postgres would make it impossible to have that same level of portability.</p>
<p>* I haven't tested all the package modules on my phone but the point is the SQLITE ones work out of the box just fine. maybe the browser ones would require downloading <code>geckodriver</code> to the PATH or more tinkering</p>
