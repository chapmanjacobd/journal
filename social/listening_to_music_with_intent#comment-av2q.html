<p>bring back the "ritualistic" aspect of listening</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't think it really matters <em>how</em> you listen to music. Anything can <strong>become</strong> a pilgrimage as it depends entirely on your state of mind. To create a ritual or to become a pilgrim you should follow this four step process:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Create space. This space can exist only temporally as a set time of day. You can't have a ritual without a narrow gate (constraints; I don't mean this in a biblical context but rather a "you have to walk a specific path to get to a specific place" type of thing). It doesn't matter exactly how much time you allocate but it is important that you <em>design</em> the target spatio-temporal area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set your intention. You should have a goal. What do you want to feel by this ritual? Maybe you want to feel relaxed. That is simple enough. Or perhaps you want to gain clarity about something that is happening in your life. It helps to have a theme that you would like to explore. This might involve creating a specific playlist <em>for</em> your music ritual.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transition. You have your everyday life and you have your pilgrimage so if you want to feel different then you have to think about what you can do to separate the two. Light candles, burn incense, or create any atmosphere that feels sacred. This signals to your mind and body that something different and important is happening.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give the music your full presence. Treat the music as you would a live performance. If you can't meditate, if you can't stop thinking, your mind won't stop racing, you can try counting backwards from 100 to 1. Or use listening time as an opportunity for reflection, or journaling. What feelings, memories, or ideas does the music bring up? Allow it to be a conduit for self-discovery.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I don't exactly do the above but I have enough music that I never have to listen to the same song twice so I try to listen to each song because I probably won't hear it ever again. I have my media player set up so that when I press next it will automatically delete the song. So there is an aspect of intentional curation:</p>
