It really depends on the underlying filesystem as well as any scratch space that your applications need to safely run. For large single disk btrfs drives I keep 20GB free--for multi-disk maybe 30 or 40GB for the whole fs. For ext4, 1GB because it isn't usually painful to recover from ENOSPC. 

btrfs is very annoying if something else went wrong at the same time as ENOSPC--it could go read-only and never want to mount read/write but [I've only experienced this once](https://gist.github.com/chapmanjacobd/7022658b51ecfae8e5255398930a8d61) or [twice](https://gist.github.com/chapmanjacobd/4fcb7a8e485651e0f997b98e0e3d1652)--most of the time with btrfs you can unmount and then remount and other than the theoretical "data loss" from a partial transaction (ie. if your application crashes on write errors) everything is fine. I still use btrfs very often because it is much better at many things than ext4--but I don't trust btrfs with low free space
