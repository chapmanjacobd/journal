<p>I shuffle between FreeRDP and NoMachine. It might also be worth trying out Xpra.</p>
<p>FreeRDP is pretty amazing but there are a couple annoying bugs like clipboard syncing isn't working for me but it might work for you. NoMachine is a bit more reliable but it is not FOSS... you could check out <a href="https://wiki.x2go.org/doku.php/doc:newtox2go">X2Go</a> which is similar to NoMachine.</p>
<p>edit: Ah your platform is Windows. I would just use RDP. It really is state of the art imho. Use Tailscale to handle the networking and use the built-in <code>mstsc</code></p>
