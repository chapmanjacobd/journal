<p>To counter this I scrape metadata: <a href="https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/library">https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/library</a>. You can watch very old videos and sort your consumption in a lot of different ways--even without downloading the videos directly.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, even with all of this I've been feeling like there is nothing new under the sun. Just the same story said in <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p02WKbar-qg">different</a></em> ways.</p>
<p>I've created a few web pages to increase arbitrary idea generation. A compound word particle accelerator if you will: <a href="https://unli.xyz/proliferation/">https://unli.xyz/proliferation/</a></p>
<p>I visit that page every day and even after a few months I still haven't seen anything really <strong>new</strong>. I see some weird combinations but after thinking for a bit I realize "oh that already exists!" or "somewhere that's a medical billing code..."</p>

<p>Consuming media is a different skill from creating media. To create something new you really need to ignore everything that has been done before. Then you need to do it until you have confidence in it. Iterate on it. Get feedback. Iterate. Create more.</p>
<p>If you're a writer you really have to force yourself to write every day. Some people write better at 4am, some people write better at 3am. Most creative stuff is like that. You need to block out a time in the day where you are removed from distractions. In that time you are forced to do the thing you want to get better at. You work the muscle.</p>

<p>Creative projects which reproduce the established norms (innovations which already have a market) are more likely to be successful. Creating a new market or a new appetite in people is a lot harder and usually not worth the effort.</p>
<p>However, if you can automate it (or pact with many people) to create enough content to define a new genre, you can have a monopoly on that genre for at least 5~10 years. The risk is in whether or not your genre is palatable enough for people and whether the market can support it: <a href="https://youtu.be/dLfsCXVIvj0?t=1241">field theory: avant-garde to consecrated avant-garde</a></p>
