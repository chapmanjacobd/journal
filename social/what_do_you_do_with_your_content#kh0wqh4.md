I wrote a CLI program that is similar to Plex and I think it handles these cases perhaps a bit better than Plex, although I haven't really used Plex or subsonic for 10+ years because I just use my program on my PC and phone (via termux).

The main reason why I think it is better is that I can add a bunch of different filters in a couple of seconds to create a playlist that will be all videos with "mario kart" in the title which are under 3 minutes, sorted by size/duration for example. `lb wt videos.db mario kart -d-3 -u size/duration`

I'm sure Plex could do this too but it seems you need to put everything into the same folder first... which kinda defeats the point of a media manager ??
