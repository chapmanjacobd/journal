> Way too many settings and options and even experts do not really agree on what settings to use

The ffmpeg defaults are pretty good. But yes if you want to fine-tune an encoding to specific conditions like animation vs live-action then figuring out a good "preset" to use for that video will give you better quality for the same output size. But beyond a certain point there are diminishing returns and the "artness" of encoding is just some form of gatekeeping that reminds me of some "pro audio recording/listening" people.

I'm thankful for the time, hard work, and compute that people who call themselves encoders offer but also the people that write encoding/decoding software have put in a lot of hours to try to make the process less magical and more accessible. I think there should be some balance here. It is a form of art to be able to squeeze out marginal gains and reach a local maxima but also there is a "god of the gaps" and a lot of BS that is created to justify gatekeeping
