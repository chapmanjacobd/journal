> For long believed in manual cataloguing but I’m starting to feel I don’t have time for that

I arrived at a similar conclusion but use different tools to manage different things. 

For documents I like Mendeley and using controlled vocabulary to name files. 

For websites and media I wrote my own [program](https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/library). I try to limit cataloging beyond indexing: take the file-system AS-IS and don't mess with it. Instead, I focus on consumption patterns and make everything quickly searchable and playable in order without needing to rename badly named files as much as possible
