I've been using it in this way almost two years. During the first month I tried a few different ways to make Johnny Decimals work for me.

It might look disorganized to you but the key here is that the numbers are grouped together. Everything that starts with 7\_ is video, everything that starts with 8\_ is audio, everything that starts with 5\_ is text or pdf.

Within each "group" I try to have the numbers increment like a pipeline. \_1 means new media. and as the numbers get higher I'm more likely to keep the files. I delete a lot of stuff so maybe that makes me less of a data hoarder and more of a curator. \_9 usually means library (stuff that I plan on never deleting)

but for some groups, like 8\_, I like making music so my organization there is bifurcated. 80-85 is other people's music. 86-89 is the music that I've created-as I have new ideas for songs they go on 86, as they get polished I put later iterations into the folders that are higher up. I don't like project-based organization for creative work because I'm not always in the mood to write lyrics vs sing vs mix vs master. In this setup I can do a diff on the folders and see what's in the pipeline and if anything has been forgotten which I've recorded before.  


So you are right there are some deviances... Another example \_0 means the folder is usually synced or it contains media that I'm currently focusing on or watching ("80" is the folder I use for music that I play offline in the car. There are scripts that run periodically to reshuffle this folder from the other music folders to keep the 1000 files that are stored there fresh and interesting). Maybe I should have used \_2 or something but Johnny Decimals encourages using \_0 for storing Metadata and I think that's a good idea--my usage is not canon JohnnyD.  

With Johnny Decimals the actual name of the folder is slightly less important than the number you use. I've gotten used to thinking with numbers since I just type the number and press tab anyway so I don't plan on fixing some of the idiosyncrasies

I try to limit the use of subfolders. I've found that they cause more trouble than they are worth. That's not to say I don't use subfolders at all--the important thing for me is that I don't have a junk folder or any junk subfolders (except for unsorted documents--but that folder is more organized than you might expect from the name).

I don't want to be my own part-time librarian so the organization is obviously not something that I would force other people to use but the organization is personal to me and I haven't had any trouble finding things.
