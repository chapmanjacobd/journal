<p>I wonder if link rot will affect your database more over time?</p>

<p>yes... it is already a big problem. Even big sites like Wired and Vice magazine have a lot of 404s. I guess they don't bother to redirect old URLs but usually I can find the article after googling the URL or pasting it into the Wayback Machine.</p>
<p>Luckily, I haven't seen a site yet which isn't available in the Wayback Machine but I've started my own little Wayback Machine (just in case) by passing all my links to <a href="https://github.com/rockdaboot/wget2">wget2</a> the past few days. There are a lot of 'Failed to connect', 'Name or service not known', and 'No address associated with hostname' errors! It's sad.</p>
