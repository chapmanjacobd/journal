<p>My small Rust project a couple weeks ago gave me more confidence to start contributing to Rust projects.</p>
<p>One of the things that has been annoying me recently is that <code>Alt+,</code>, which I use to duplicate command-line arguments, does not behave the same behavior as <code>Alt+.</code>:</p>
<pre><code>bind --preset \e. history-token-search-backward
bind \e, backward-kill-bigword yank yank
</code></pre>
<p>So I turned my frustration into a PR: <a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10738">https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10738</a></p>
