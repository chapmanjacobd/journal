I already have too much content to watch in one lifetime and the same program I llinked above helps me watch random videos with specific duration constraints in episode order so I only spend a few seconds finding something to watch.

I have a list of about 20,000 more YouTube channel URLs that I'm not subscribed to but slowly checking before downloading. A lot of these are musicians and music collection channels so there is less overlap than, for example, science education channels which cover overlapping content
