It's a multi-destination budgeting and destination explorer app that will show you how much the estimated cost of your whole trip will be in terms of price per day. 

  


Right now it's missing a lot of features but it's usable. I need to know what direction I should go with it. it only shows direct flights right now

  


here it is: \[UNLI Travel\](https://travel.unli.xyz)

  


Which options would you like to have available once you have chosen your multiple destination itinerary?

  


a) We show you links for the flight you need and hotel or hostel for each segment of your trip. You will need to track the prices on your own because we use low average prices instead of live prices

  


b) For a modest fee, we book all of your hotel/flights when the price of each segment is low. 

  


c) We track the prices and email you when the price is low

  


d) something else??

  


I appreciate your feedback and ideas
