<p>I know you specifically mentioned a desire for an app but I'll just quickly mention what I do.</p>
<p><code>yt-dlp</code> works with RSS feeds or things that appear like them. The Generic extractor is rather good. You can install it in Termux and run a list of URLs on a cron script in your phone via <code>cronie</code>. I guess if you don't use Termux often you'll also need <a href="https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Termux:Boot">Termux:Boot</a> for cronie to work and download new episodes on a schedule</p>
