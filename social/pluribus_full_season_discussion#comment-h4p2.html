<p>better communicators and listeners</p>

<p>One plausible excuse is that it is just the worst parts of the wisdom of the crowds: instead of each expert speaking up when they have high confidence of knowing the answer it is just the average answer getting the most weight similar to early large-language models.</p>
<p>This still allows for everyone to reach easy consensus on the degrees Celsius or flying an aircraft but for questions of communication? A lot more mouths have opinions and so the consensus becomes averaged down by a wider bell curve.</p>
<p>But really, all the miscommunication is a plot device that provides conflict so that the show isn't just a bunch of pages of exposition.</p>
<p>I also suspect that it's not <em>impossible</em> for them to lie--just that lying doesn't make sense within the hivemind because others will instantly know that they are lying--and it's at the advantage of the hivemind that Carol believes that they can lie. It's only useful to lie after someone trusts you. Given that Carol repeats "they can't lie" so many times in season 1 I suspect this learned "truth" may be called into question at a climactic point in season 2.</p>
<p>I suspect that in season 2 they'll use the nuke as leverage while trying to find a way to broadcast at a specific frequency. The fact that cell phones don't work is probably because it is within the same frequency range and they'll reuse cell towers to jam the hivemind wavelength.</p>
