<p>I quite like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peep_Show_(British_TV_series)">Peep Show</a> (British). It's 54 episodes of 2003~2015 David Mitchell and Robert Webb with experimental POV cimematography and lots of inner monologue. I was pretty sad after I finished the last episode but it had a good run.</p>
<p>Embrace of the Serpent (El abrazo de la serpiente, 2015) is a great film. Fitzcarraldo (1982) is a crazy movie. Both of these films should probably be seen without looking up the details. Let the story unravel on the screen.</p>
