<p>If this happens again, <code>ssh -vvv</code> does wonders to figure out where it is hanging or why it doesn't use a <em>specific</em> private key.</p>
<p>One thing that has caused issues recently is a setting like this in my <code>.gitconfig</code>:</p>
<pre><code>[url "ssh://git@github.com/"]
  insteadOf = https://github.com/
</code></pre>
