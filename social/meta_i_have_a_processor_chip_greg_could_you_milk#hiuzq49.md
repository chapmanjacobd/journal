> do all of these devices contain the same untapped potentional like my router once did?

the answer to this problem of untapped potentional is called Free as in Freedom software

nearly every device has some untapped potentional but creating custom functionality without the blessing of the manufacturer is a tremendous task and generally not worth the time for one individual to do. it happens because deeply self-motivated people exist but most often because many people band together to do something. 

In a FOSS world the barrier to add a feature or fix some functionality is much lower and there would be much less untapped potentional (for example, many more devices would have features which only you and 1,000 other people on Earth could appreciate)

but for something like a printer usually there are no benefits to modifying firmware (one of the only exceptions would be to bypass ink level BS or if you were printing money) 

so it is less likely that people have invested time unless they have motivation for doing so. usually this is because the manufacturer restricted the rights of the enduser in arbitrary or commercial ways. if the defaults are good and restrictions are only in place for safety reasons then only motivation people would have to hack or jailbreak a device is to create an unsafe condition or purely for learning the skill or feeling the challenge.

not only do programmers need to reverse engineer the firmware updating process but for end-users without JTAG equipment they need to find an exploit or a bug to get homebrew or custom firmware onto the device.

there are many devices which have a custom firmware community. most gaming consoles are eventually opened up. many consumer grade cameras have custom firmware--especially if there is a prosumer version of the same camera model which uses very similar hardware such that modifying the software with unlock more features or higher quality video capture. 

just search "device name" + homebrew, CFW or custom firmware, modding, hacks, rooting, custom ROM, or jailbreak

security systems are an interesting topic to bring up. you wouldn't want a remote hacker to be able to take over your home security, right? so generally companies like ring are very motivated to secure their software.

modifying a secure system or allowing the end-user to modify it will increase the probability that it is misconfigured or open to possible misuse.

there likely are more open solutions than ring or wyze but you will pay a modest premium because your data isn't being sold by a hypothetical FOSS home security system company and most people don't want to spend tome configuring things so less users means the economics of scale are lower so things are more expensive to produce
