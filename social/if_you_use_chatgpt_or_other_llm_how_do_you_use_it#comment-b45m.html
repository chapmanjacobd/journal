<p>It's very nice to quickly stub out some tests with sample data.</p>
<p>Sometimes I use it to check my personal code for dumb logic errors like breaking out of a nested for loop.</p>
<p>The answers they provide are not always helpful but the immediate response helps to speed up feedback loops faster than talking to a rubber ducky would.</p>
<p>Some tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are having trouble finding the answer in Google, try an LLM.</li>
<li>If you are having trouble with an LLM, try Google.</li>
<li>The point is to give up easily and pivot. Don't waste time starting from scratch. Most problems encountered in a professional setting are not new problems.</li>
<li>But also be thorough and continue to research after finding a solution.<br/>
For example, I was having trouble recently scraping data from a site that used Shadow DOM. After a few hours of tinkering I finally got it working in python but it was a bit slow and I still had a few tabs left from earlier research. One of those tabs helped me to know that it is much faster to solve the problem in javascript: <a href="https://gist.github.com/chapmanjacobd/69075d77dae99c71a4195f01963830c3">https://gist.github.com/chapmanjacobd/69075d77dae99c71a4195f01963830c3</a></li>
<li>LLMs can take ambiguous language and give you the right words to search in Google. Maybe you are interested in searching about a new topic but you don't know you need to call it "combining rankings" or "music information retrieval" and talking with an LLM can help reveal those "academic passphrases" to find the right kind of research papers that you might be looking for.</li>
<li>Translating code between languages. It does the right thing &gt;80% of the time.</li>
</ul>
