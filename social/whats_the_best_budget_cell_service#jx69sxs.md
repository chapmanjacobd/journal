Check with your ISP. I was able to get a phone, unlimited calls and texts, 1GB monthly data, all with paying only about $5 more per month due to multi-product discounts.

Before that I didn't pay for cell service. This might be unrealistic for you--especially if your job requires a phone. But it is probably easier than you might think. There are apps like Google Voice to enable calls or texts over the internet. So if you always have WiFi you don't really need cell service.
