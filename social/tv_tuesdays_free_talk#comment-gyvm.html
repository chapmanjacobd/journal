<p>I binged <em>The Chair Company</em> in a day and mostly enjoyed it. There are times when the dialogue and story beats feel like an LLM being prompted to write a weird story--while other beats are quietly masterful. The final episode is perfect in the sense that it gives you many possible interpretations to take home. I'm likely to regard it more highly as the days go by but right now it feels more <em>Tommy Wiseau</em> than <em>Twin Peaks</em>.</p>
