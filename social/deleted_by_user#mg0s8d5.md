Given that you hold EU citizenship you have a lot of options over there. Personally, I feel like that is a great place to be right now. Nothing wrong with heading down to HK for a few months every year. HK is a fun place to walk around and explore but after a few years you'll probably get bored.

HK$59K is definitely enough if you're single and somewhat frugal. HK pricing is competitive compared to other world cities but it's not cheap either. It really depends on your expectations, lifestyle, and what you need to splurge on to feel comfortable.
