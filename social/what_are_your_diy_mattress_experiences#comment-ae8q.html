<p>I didn't buy the sheets or the adjustable base from the mattress company. Those were bought separately but yes this was a couple years ago. There are many adjustable bed options and you don't need a fancy one. I see some on Amazon for $250 right now (shipping inclusive) and there is one by Okeene for $160 on Wayfair with free shipping.</p>
