<p>I think most people don't really care about the exact altitude of the plane because it is a figure of speech. I think the word for it is metonymy?</p>
<p>If the article said "at or above 30,000 feet" or "between 33,000 and 42,000 feet" instead of 40,000 feet it would seem oddly specific and it might not make people think of air travel as immediately</p>
