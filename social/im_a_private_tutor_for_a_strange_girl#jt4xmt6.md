> She finished interviewing me and offered me time to ask questions, “Why are the widows covered?”

When I first skimmed through this It seemed like the little girl was asking this question. Transitions between subjects like this should be broken into two complete sentences.

But it might be good to remove that part. It might be more subtle to have her offer to turn on a light or open the curtain to get more light if the room is really dark. Only if the windows are boarded up it or something like that then it makes sense for her to ask a "WHY" question. If there is already enough light in the room to see then I imagine the tutor won't say anything or notice anything is really "wrong" if their eyes have already adjusted to the light.

I think the portrait thing is a bit of a cliche. A well-adapted vampire will want to get with the times and hide obvious indicators that they are not a normal human--or they will provide an interesting story for why they want to be known as a vampire and they will want to make you a deal that you couldn't refuse ($100,000 a month, etc) but it is really a lot safer to not reveal that you are a vampire. DENY, DENY, DENY everything.
