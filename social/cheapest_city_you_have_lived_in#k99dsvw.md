Lao pork has a unique flavor. It's pork but hard to compare to anything I've eaten before. Even if you don't like pork you should try it once or twice just because it tastes so different. Lots of different dishes to try with it--there's even lao pork lasagna and it is the bomb.com.

But you can find any food that you want in downtown Vientiane. Prices vary, lunch is usually between 1 ~ 8 USD, dinner 5 ~ 15 USD, and I never had a bad meal.

Nightlife is a lot less than Vietnam and Thailand but you can still find places to have fun
