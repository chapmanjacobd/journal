I would export to CSV then use csvjson

`pip3 install  --user csvkit`

but if you want the updated spreadsheet to show people then I would just send a public view-only sheet link tbh

If you want to make a table like this: [https://unli.xyz/countries/](https://unli.xyz/countries/)

then you can steal my code whatevs: [https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/cities](https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/cities)
