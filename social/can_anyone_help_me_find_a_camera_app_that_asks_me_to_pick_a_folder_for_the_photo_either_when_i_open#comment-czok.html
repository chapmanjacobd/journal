<p>I wonder if it would be useful enough for the OP to have a simple widget that when you click it, it would move all the recently taken photos into a new, named, folder.</p>
<p>Push a button. Take a bunch of photos with normal camera apps, even switching between different apps. Then push the button again and you have a folder with only the recent photos</p>
