<p>I've been dumping hours into <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> (it's free this week on Epic Games Store) and it's decent overall. Better than I would expect it to be.</p>
<p>It's fun to roleplay in and zoom around on a broom. There's quite a few low quality side quests but the variety of spells and other game mechanics make it slightly more tolerable.</p>
<p>If you decide to try it out, I've heard both Hufflepuff and Slytherin playthroughs offer the more interesting distinct quests. I'm playing Ravenclaw. There's not a big difference though whatever you pick</p>
