<p>Here is something I learned very recently and I'm glad that they made a footnote about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Something that’s barely related to Weird Al’s work is the fact that thanks to US law regarding “compulsory mechanical license” (17 U.S.C. § 115), if someone releases a song to the public, other people can force that original artist to give them a license to reproduce and distribute their own cover version of the song without needing the songwriters permission, just so long as they follow statutory rules and pay the regulated royalty rate, don’t “change the basic melody or fundamental character of the work.”</p>
<p>What this means in practice is that you can do a cover of a famous song, and as long as you pay the royalty rate, you do not need to wait for Lady Gaga to give you the thumbs up, which might be convenient to you as a random person who won’t get the time of day from her publicist.</p>
<p>The irony is that Weird Al’s versions are not enabled by this specific license, because he substantially changes the words and changes the “fundamental character of the work,” making them derivative works, rather than simple covers. (It is also worth mentioning that Weird Al, for his part, probably doesn’t want this arrangement; part of what he negotiates for is a songwriting credit, which in practice means a more favorable rate for him)</p>
