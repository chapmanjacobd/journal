For me personally, I use `C:/users/username/projects/` because I only use Windows for work and I organize each different task as its own project folder. I recommend using `scoop` to install programs but for small lightweight ones or configuration I put that in `C:/users/username/bin/` but you could also do `C:/users/username/programs/`.

Here's two links that might be helpful... I use this program to [create folders programmatically](https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/computer/blob/main/bin/mktree.py) and here are my [Windows dotfiles](https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/computer/tree/main/.github/Windows). But there is a lot of power in keeping things simple

I second the advice about syncing... You can use syncthing and git in the same folder... just add the `.git` folder in `.stignore`. I wouldn't install syncthing on a work machine though
