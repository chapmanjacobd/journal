<p>Another option you might not have considered is just to ignore everything related to responsibilities of being a US citizen until you need to go there. This is not a decent thing to do but it is less extreme than renouncing citizenship.</p>
<p>There is no statute of limitations on unfiled tax returns, but in most cases, the IRS only looks back six years. You should look into the specifics for your situation. I imagine that fixing your relationship with the IRS after ignoring them for 10+ years would be difficult, but it might be easier than trying to get citizenship after renouncing it. It <em>might</em> even be a cheaper too. The IRS might seize your passport. You might be assessed with criminal tax evasion penalties and you might lose your right to claim refunds for prior years. But those things <strong>could</strong> also happen even if you did your very best to file tax returns and follow the laws.</p>
