Your comment is appreciated but I was only speaking of the black people thing as a pattern of colonialism and gentrification. The OP used this example and it didn't sit well with me. 

I can't speak of the other thing because there is an information war happening right now and it's difficult to know what is 'the truth' even if you believe what you know and I deem you to be a good person
