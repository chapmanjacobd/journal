This sub isn't really dead. I've found more amazing music here than any other subreddit. It isn't popular and that might be a big reason why content is higher quality other than a small amount of spammers who also post here

edit: my strategy with this sub and other slower moving subs is [RSS feed](https://www.reddit.com/r/trueMusic/top/.rss?sort=top&t=day)
