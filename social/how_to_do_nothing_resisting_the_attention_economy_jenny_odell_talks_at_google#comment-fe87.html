<p>It is essentially mindfulness: introspection (learning to recognize internal thoughts and feelings clearly and understanding where those thoughts and feelings come from and learning how to get more of them or less of them as you desire) and then self-reflexivity (evaluating actions and their impact on oneself and the world, over time).</p>
<p>And it is about having the non-work time and the privacy to use and improve those two skills. A society that values and supports growing mindfulness. Being okay with <em>regenerative</em> non-productivity to the point of erring on the side of some unproductivity. There are <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/productivity">different qualities</a> of productivity and different qualities of leisure time. Some is high-quality and some is low-quality. For many people it takes a lot of low-quality time to plan and effectively use your high-quality (most salient) moments.</p>
<p>Maintenance-oriented work with its slow improvement is less sexy than <em>moving fast and breaking things</em> but we should regard both with the same amount of reverence and skepticism. Cultures that reject order are unpredictable and unstable. Cultures that reject chaos are often rigid and inflexible--weak to changes--reality changes and people fall through the cracks of bureaucracy. Brittle systems.</p>
<p>Robust / efficient / productive systems have conflicting independent parts. The power of each part in the system comes from its pressure on the other systems and the equal-and-opposite pressure of the other systems against it: balanced by pushing against the other. Neither 100% chaos nor 100% order.</p>
