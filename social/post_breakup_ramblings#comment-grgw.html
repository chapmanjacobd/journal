<blockquote>
<p>this is her first romantic relationship</p>

<p>It sounds like you could eventually get back together but right now she wants to know what other relationships could be like before she commits to something more.</p>
<p>I think you should prepare to end things amicably or at least pretend to so that the loss of you as a potential partner feels real. Maybe she'll come back but maybe she won't.</p>
