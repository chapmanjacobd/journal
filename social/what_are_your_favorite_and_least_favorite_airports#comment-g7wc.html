<p>Kaohsiung (KHH) is a really fun airport. Really lovely design. It doesn't feel too big. I think a problem with a lot of airports is they feel too big. Even Naha airport (OKA) feels a little bit too big... On the other hand ORD and LAX don't feel that big because of the shuttle service between terminals.</p>
<p>Philippines and Malaysian airports are often crowded and poorly managed / under-staffed. Iloilo airport is okay but it also feels too small in many places.</p>
<p>There's a lot to love about Incheon airport (ICN). The rail connection / transit center layout and transition to airport is very bright and lovely. My only complaint is that it feels a bit far from Seoul.</p>
<p>Orange County airport (SNA) has a nice layout but baggage claim is kinda confusing. You can easily walk to another building and then realize you need to walk back two terminals because it is actually located in a different terminal from the one you arrived in. They need to change the way that they label the baggage claim areas so that it is more obvious instead of doing sequential numbers when they aren't in the same area.</p>
<p>Salt Lake City airport (SLC) has a lot of interesting features and I've never had to wait long to go through security. I like the very distinct separation between the security area and the terminal. That whole dropoff to terminal experience feels very well designed. However, the terminal itself is bland and boring. I can't quite put my finger on it but it doesn't feel like a space for humans.</p>
<p>Also, it is really annoying when flying through the USA to have to re-check your bag. It feels so asinine and arbitrary. I'm glad for airports that make it easy.</p>
