> skeletons in the heart of the island

It isn't explained in the show https://lostpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Skeleton

> Jacob as the bad guy, MiB as a good person

I think that's what the writers intended you to feel. They want to show that good and evil are not black and white. yin-yang

> What was "mother's" magic from

She was the protector of the island before Jacob became it. Being the protector of the island allows you some magic.

> how did she learn to use it

That's an interesting question. How did the island start? I don't think the show ever answered that 

> Egyptian statue and the Temple tie into everything

This is copied from lostpedia:

> The Egyptians were active on the Island after Mother slaughtered Claudia's people, Jacob became the Island's protector, and the Man in Black was transformed into the Monster. When Mother killed the intruders and filled in the well where the Man in Black was building the frozen wheel, the walls of the underground chamber were blank and the wheel was not yet put into place. 

> However, when Ben turned the wheel in 2004, and Locke did so at an unknown time, the wheel had been mounted and its mechanism completed, and the chamber has been inscribed with hieroglyphs. 

The mural of the monster and Anubis is interesting. Anubis is the prominent lord of the dead. Within the mural I feel like Anubis is Jacob. The monster is the Man in Black. They are at odds with each other but they also hold a playful relationship which binds them together even though they both resent each other. This ties in with the [Bottle and Cork](https://lostpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Bottle_and_cork) analogy that Jacob uses to explain the island to Richard.

The game that Jacob discovered is an Egyptian game. Jacob also spent many hours weaving hieroglyphics into tapestry. While the island may have a unique relationship with time, I don't think the island exists outside of time and it mostly travels linearly with history. It's possible that Jacob, as protector of the island, wished Egyptian people to the island because he was interested in that culture. Or perhaps Jacob built everything that is Egyptian on the island (he lives in the statue of Taweret, goddess of protection). This would mean that he wanted to free the Man in Black (because it would mean Jacob finished building the wheel) but he wouldn't be able to do so without a loophole which would also mean removing himself as protector of the island.

Ahhh... I just realized something. Jacob leaves the island many times. It is likely that Jacob completed the wheel by himself (or with his Egyptian buddies) and he used that to go to and from the island.

Perhaps a more specific question is how "the Others" tie into the temple.

https://lostpedia.fandom.com/wiki/The_Others#Pre-crash_history

This page is interesting and it clarified that "the Others" is a fairly recent thing. Building the temple either happened after the Egyptians all died (if they ever existed on the island) or it was re-used for the purposes of Richard / Jacob.

https://lostpedia.fandom.com/wiki/The_Temple

It is not specified when The Temple was built but I imagine it was built by Jacob or by Jacob's instructions because there are hieroglyphics in there. But it is possible that Jacob instructed Richard to build it and taught him what symbols to write. I think the magic permeating from the hieroglyphics is not because hieroglyphics are magical but because Jacob, as protector of the island, created rules for the island that hieroglyphics would have some magic power.

> Ben never saw Jacob while he was the leader of the others, but did Charles Whitmore

doubtful.
