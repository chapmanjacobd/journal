<p>Silence (2016) is pretty good. The 1971 version has its charms but the remake is definitely more accessible and better pacing. I would say it lived up to the original <em>on average</em>. Some parts were significantly better while the ending feels a bit weird. I never read the original novel so I'm not sure which is more true-to-the-book but they are definitely different feeling endings.</p>
