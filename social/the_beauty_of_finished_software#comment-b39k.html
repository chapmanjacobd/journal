<p>I would argue that static HTML can have beauty. I'm not talking about CSS. Rather how an HTML document which is written, edited, and manicured well can reach perfection.</p>
<p>Perfection is achieved not when you've squashed all bugs and added all the features which could be brainstormed. Perfection is achieved when you have a limited set of features which work well enough and everything extraneous has been eliminated. It is usually pretty obvious when HTML documents have been refined over time.</p>
<p>Wikipedia is a good example of this at least in terms of large sample size with consistent quality. Generally, after a certain point articles stabilize where nothing can really be added or removed from an article. It's like a bonsai tree. Documents written by one person can be similar--but perfection is only achieved through constant effort to re-visit prior work and improve it.</p>
<p>80% of the value comes from 20% of the features. Prioritizing the vital 20% leads to simpler, more usable products.</p>
<p>I often see webapps that have complicated functionality, hundreds of animations, and millions of CSS classes; and yet, it is often the case that the purpose of the website would be better solved as a simple FAQ document with an attached spreadsheet, HTML form, or CSV download. People often want that anyway. Not to mention making sites simple documents makes them more durable (easier for robots to archive it) and more accessible (screen readers, etc).</p>
<p>Not everything can be a simple document, but 80% of React et al. websites that I've seen could easily be HTML5 with no JavaScript.</p>

<p>which you can't get paid to write</p>

<p>There are plenty of people that are paid to make websites. Customers often have no idea whether you are using the latest JS shadow DOM framework abomination or whether you are using Bootstrap and jQuery abomination. Technical Writers get paid rather well even in this post-GenAI world.</p>
