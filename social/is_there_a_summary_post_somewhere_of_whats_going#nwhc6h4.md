Okay I read the first 100 posts last month and just finished reading the remaining 100... and my summary is this:

- nel0x archived his repo to "[not be a competing one](https://forum.syncthing.net/t/does-anyone-know-why-syncthing-fork-is-no-longer-available-on-github/25661/221)" against researchxxl's (the one that Catfriend1/syncthing-android redirects to)
- Catfriend1, or someone with their account access, finally [posted a message](https://forum.syncthing.net/t/does-anyone-know-why-syncthing-fork-is-no-longer-available-on-github/25661/165)
- There is a lot of fear, uncertainty, and doubt largely manifested from Catfriend1 and researchxxl not being communicative with the community during the handoff of the repo as discussed in comments [114](https://forum.syncthing.net/t/does-anyone-know-why-syncthing-fork-is-no-longer-available-on-github/25661/114), [117](https://forum.syncthing.net/t/does-anyone-know-why-syncthing-fork-is-no-longer-available-on-github/25661/117), [128](https://forum.syncthing.net/t/does-anyone-know-why-syncthing-fork-is-no-longer-available-on-github/25661/128)

Personally, I'm not too impressed with researchxxl's communication nor coding skills. It seems to be largely LLM written code--but Catfriend1 was also using a lot of AI:

- https://github.com/researchxxl/syncthing-android/issues/16#issuecomment-3618898346

Personally, I'm using Syncthing-Fork v1.30.0.4 but I'll probably switch to running syncthing in Termux when I switch to another phone. (Having an app GUI is convenient but there's more code and more chances for bugs than just running syncthing via Termux.)

Still, Syncthing v1.30 is working fine for now and it is fully interoperable with Syncthing v2 running on other devices so you could likely keep using older versions like Syncthing Fork v2.0.11.2 with no major problems for a long while.
