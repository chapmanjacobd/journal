Prices on eBay, for the lower end (<16TB), have been relatively stable over the past year: https://unli.xyz/diskprices/us/

If your situation allows for it you can buy 3TB/4TB and sometimes even 6TB SAS drives for less than $5/TB. Warranties on these drives are usually under 3 months. I have about 20 of these and use them for cold storage and haven't had any drive fail yet. But if you want more storage per watt this won't make sense for you.

And if you can only use SATA drives there is less used/refurbished inventory at the moment and the price per TB is easily double.
