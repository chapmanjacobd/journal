Calibre-Web exists! That sounds like what you want. 

Otherwise I would recommend keeping things as simple as possible and use folder names and file names. The folder/file convention will last at least another 50 years so at least you won't need to worry about software becoming unsupported or migrating metadata between systems. There are also a lot of good tools out there for searching text files.
