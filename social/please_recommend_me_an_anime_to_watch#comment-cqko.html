<p>Here are some of my favorites:</p>
<ul>
<li>Baccano! (Comedy, 1930s Manhattan)</li>
<li>Darker than Black (Sci-Fi, <em>big mood</em>, music by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE5DEFB24AB2E00B0">Yoko Kanno</a> who also composed Cowboy Bebop)</li>
<li>Detroit Metal City (Comedy, death metal band, the manga is also fantastic)</li>
<li>Space Dandy (basically a parody of Cowboy Bebop but it stands on its own well)</li>
<li>Samurai Champloo (soundtrack by Nujabes)</li>
<li>Love Complex (yes, this is J-Drama but <a href="https://archive.org/details/love-complex">it's so ridiculous</a> it is basically anime)</li>
<li>Patlabor 2 is <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1cnwou5/partlabor_2_is_honestly_one_of_the_most/">underrated</a>. It also has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Patlabor_episodes#Patlabor:_The_TV_Series">TV show</a></li>
</ul>
