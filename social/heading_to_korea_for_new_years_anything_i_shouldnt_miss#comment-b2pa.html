<p>Well... 3 days is not a lot of time in either city. I doubt you'll have time, but I highly recommend a day trip to Gyeongju. I spent two weeks in Gyeongju and never ran out of things to do, eat, or see.</p>
<p>I guess my generic recommendation is try to go hiking at least once. Busan will be easier to find good hiking spots. Enjoy it!</p>
