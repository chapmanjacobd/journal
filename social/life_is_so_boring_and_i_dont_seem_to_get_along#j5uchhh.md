If you feel life is boring, moving to the mountains is one way to solidify that belief. There's a big world out there... a better life can be found or, more often, constructed, by yourself (or with the friends that you make along the way).

You should try to find a community outside of your workplace. If you live in a city with more than 10,000 people it is likely there are at least 3 people who have similar hobbies with you AND feel similar to you right now.

If this is your inner desire, there is nothing wrong with it; but it sounds like you are yearning for a more connected life.

If you are wondering how to get started feeling more connected with your community, I've created some programs to randomize your life:

- [Random Walk generator](https://unli.xyz/walk/) -- discover your neighborhood. You might even meet some neighbors!
- [City Window](https://unli.xyz/city/window/) -- virtually travel to another city on Earth
- [City Abacus](https://unli.xyz/city/calc/) -- plan long-term travel

If you don't really have hobbies then I recommend forcing yourself to go into different environments at fixed intervals like every 2 or 3 hours. Try people watching. You are more likely to find where you fit in through movement
