Think about how you would consume the data or hand it off to someone else. If it's a project that is a mix of documents, videos, and photos then you might want to keep the context of all the related files together. 

Be careful when choosing categories because they often have overlap: ie. what about Law History and History Law? Or Cat Law?

Also two things that I've learned:

- Fewer levels of nested folders is usually better and makes it easier to find stuff. But also don't dump 150,000 files into a single folder. After you get 10,000+ files in a single folder, filesystems start to be less efficient. At some point you would want to abstract away from tree-based file hierarchy.
- Folders which contain both folders and files can usually be cleaned up by moving the files up a level or into a "metadata" subfolder
