Fedora KDE is S-tier Linux. 

It's better that people find it only after getting their distro-hopping out of the way else they end up among the riff-raff of the BunsenLabs, NixOS/Voids, Gentoos, and Slackwares....

What makes Fedora special is the boring stuff: sane defaults, a balance between outdated and bleeding edge, and patches arrive really fast when stuff breaks.
