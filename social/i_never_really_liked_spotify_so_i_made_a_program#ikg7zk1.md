cool I hadn't heard of this one. I heavily used Subsonic / Madsonic about a decade ago. That worked really well for me for a few years. I tried out Foldplay recently but it felt kinda clunky.

For mobile usage I finally figured out how to use Termux just a few months ago and that has been really productive for me. I use my same program on Android via the same `pip install xklb` and I use Tasker to send Bluetooth events to mpv running in tmux (as well as media control so I can delete the song that I don't like without even touching my phone). when I get in the car music starts playing automatically (via Tasker) because my phone connects with the bluetooth and stops automatically when the car turns off.

Last week I got a Monster Boomerang Neckband Bluetooth Speaker that I do the same thing with for riding my bike. I highly recommend that weird speaker
