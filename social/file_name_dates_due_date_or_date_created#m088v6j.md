I would use the due date since that is more of a "business key" than the creation date.

Windows has pretty good support for storing and keeping the original creation date as file metadata. Unfortunately Linux (and I'm assuming Mac OS) programs often conflate this File Creation metadata with File Modified metadata so you need to be careful when copying/moving/editing files.
