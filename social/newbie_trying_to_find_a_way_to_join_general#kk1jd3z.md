This has some good info: https://wiki.installgentoo.com/index.php/Private_trackers

If you like music RED is one of the best to get started. MAM is also amazing if you like books / audiobooks. After a few months on these I have no doubts you'll find a way to get into other trackers.

If you are in a rush buying a seedbox through TL is not the worst thing you can do but rutracker is almost as good for many types of content
