Cassettes have two sides so after 40mins or maybe 80mins of playback you could either rewind the tape to play the same side again or flip over the cassette to play the other side without needing to rewind it because the two sides of the tape are in reverse direction. They wouldn't have the same music on both sides so you might have four songs on one side then four different songs on the other side of the magnetic tape.

  


Usually flipping the cassette is done manually but this machine is automatic
