I disagree with the comment that says "hadn’t worked out the mythology yet and it’s full of alternate stuff". I think I understand what they were trying to do.

With the international pilot it's a dream sequence starting from when Susan goes to sleep (after taking one last drag from her cigarette) all the way to the end. It's very difficult to see this without first watching Episodes 2-3, but I agree it's not necessary to watch it. Nearly everything that happens in the Susan+Dale Cooper dream is retold by either Susan or Dale Cooper in Episode 4-5
