<p>It really just depends what you are comfortable with and what feels intuitive for you. There's nothing wrong with GarageBand. It doesn't make sense to use Pro Tools for everything unless that is where you feel the most comfortable and efficient.</p>
<p>Personally, I like Sony Vegas. It feels very intuitive to me and the simplicity/limitations of it makes me focus on the important stuff. But it's a video editor... so I can't really recommend it publicly and be taken seriously.</p>
<p>Some people are really good at coming up with songs in their head and jotting things directly into Sibelius. Other people can get a lot done in Notepad or other simple text editing tools. I don't think this is for everyone but if you are able and willing to put in <em>quality</em> practice time I don't think it's <em>impossible</em> to learn how to copy these kinds of people--it's just that some people are quicker at learning these kinds of things (and that might be because they've spent a not insignificant amount of time doing something similar and building up those mental imaging skills--but this also ties into Nature vs Nurture and I digress...)</p>
<p>Since you mentioned MIDI and websites specifically, I think there are a lot of small sites that are pretty neat for exploring ideas and playing around with sounds programmatically. Here are a few (some are more esoteric than others) but there are dozens more:</p>

<p>Simple (or tutorial) sites like <a href="learningsynths.ableton.com">Ableton</a>'s or <a href="https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com">Chrome MusicLab</a> are actually really good for exploring ideas because you are forced to make the most of the small set of functionality which can help kickstart the creative muscle.</p>
