<p>I mean... If you type that into Google I get "Chicago Boys" in the <a href="https://www.promarket.org/2021/09/12/chicago-boys-chile-friedman-neoliberalism/">3rd</a> and <a href="https://www.hoover.org/research/what-latin-america-owes-chicago-boys">4th</a> result. Is it just that the "rubber ducky" UX of LLM prompt interfaces encourages more lengthy and casual searching?
