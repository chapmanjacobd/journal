If you have specific channels in mind you can try this website I made: 

https://unli.xyz/eject/

I made it to "eject" from the YouTube algorithm. It's a lightweight version of a [CLI tool](https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/library) which has similar goals.

You mentioned archive of old videos and I have to say that the Internet Archive has stored many deleted YT videos! You can access them if you have the video id: `https://web.archive.org/web/2oe_/http://wayback-fakeurl.archive.org/yt/$video_id` (related [backfill code](https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/library#backfill-data))
