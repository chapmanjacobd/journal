<p>Since we are talking about <em>Kentucky Route Zero</em>, I'd like to also recommend <em>Road 96</em>. It's totally different but some parts are unintentionally "uncanny valley" in the situational sense. The repetitious dialogue options and mediocre writing (at times) add an element of surreality. It's an imperfect game with moments of greatness.</p>
<p>And if you haven't seen <em>Twin Peaks</em> you must see S01 at least!</p>
