> what makes you go through the negativity and contribute to the open source world?

I usually work on OSS out of spite and hate for the status quo. It's annoying that computers don't make things easy. It's annoying when things are inconsistent. I try to make the world slightly more cohesive and integrated.

Personally, I don't think "trolls" exist. I believe people are almost always acting "bona fide"--if only out of their own self-interest. But there are many differences of opinion that people can have. 

What might seem valuable to you might be incompatible with the expectations and preferences that others have. Some people are good at being nice. Others aren't. Feedback can hurt but it can also be useful. 

If people aren't responding in the way that you like maybe you didn't find the right audience, things aren't baked enough yet, or maybe your approach is wrong (eg. setting and managing expectations: show how specific features contrast with the status quo, keep it very simple, most people don't care about implementation details).
