<p>I made something kind of similar before but for all cities around the world--not just US cities:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://unli.xyz/city/calc/">https://unli.xyz/city/calc/</a> -- click "edit city filters" and you'll see hundreds of characteristics that you can filter cities on via quantiles (the ecology filters like rain, wind, and temperature are based on the "start date" in the upper-right corner)</li>
<li><a href="https://unli.xyz/city/honeymoon/">https://unli.xyz/city/honeymoon/</a> -- this one is mostly focused on multiple passport / visa rendezvous. I made it to pick a city to travel with my friends. But it also shows historical temperature, rain, and wind. It's probably most useful for planning international conferences with lots of different passport and origin city combinations.</li>
</ul>
