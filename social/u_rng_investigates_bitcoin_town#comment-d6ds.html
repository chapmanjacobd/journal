<p>+3 dB is double. But you are right +10 dB seems to be subjectively twice as loud even though it is 10x as much <del>sound pressure</del> power on a linear scale</p>

<p>edit: +6 dB the sound pressure is double and +20 db the sound pressure is ten times greater. I was confusing dBm and dB SPL <a href="https://audiojudgement.com/how-to-calculate-decibels/">https://audiojudgement.com/how-to-calculate-decibels/</a> page 3 and 4 is also helpful: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041109095430/http://www.indiana.edu/%7eemusic/etext/acoustics/chapter1_amplitude3.shtml">https://web.archive.org/web/20041109095430/http://www.indiana.edu/%7eemusic/etext/acoustics/chapter1_amplitude3.shtml</a></p>
