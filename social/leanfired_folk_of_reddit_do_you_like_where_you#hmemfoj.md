all of the weather filters are relevant to the current start_date that you have selected in the travel list (or if you have a destination in your travel plan then it would be the average weather of the month that you would travel to the next place -- or the next month if you are close to the end of the month)

so that would be for Daytona in December if you didn't change the start date

(although to be honest I'm guesstimating a little bit. If somewhere rains only a little bit every day it is counted as not a very rainy place for that month)
