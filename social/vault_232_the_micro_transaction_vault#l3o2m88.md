Microtransactions need to go beyond everyday services. Most of us need to pay for water and food and special massages in real life so those don't count as microtransactions.

> The door refused to open. It said, “Five cents, please.”
He searched his pockets. No more coins; nothing. “I’ll pay you tomorrow,” he told the door. Again he tried the knob. Again it remained locked tight. “What I pay you,” he informed it, “is in the nature of a gratuity; I don’t have to pay you.”
“I think otherwise,” the door said. “Look in the purchase contract you signed when you bought this conapt.”
In his desk drawer he found the contract; since signing it he had found it necessary to refer to the document many times. Sure enough; payment to his door for opening and shutting constituted a mandatory fee. Not a tip.
“You discover I’m right,” the door said. It sounded smug.
From the drawer beside the sink Joe Chip got a stainless steel knife; with it he began systematically to unscrew the bolt assembly of his apt’s money-gulping door.
“I’ll sue you,” the door said as the first screw fell out.
Joe Chip said, “I’ve never been sued by a door. But I guess I can live through it.”

Vault Dwellers need to pay each time they go through a door. They need to pay for each second that a door remains open. They need to pay a tax for every step that they take in common areas. They need to pay every time they yawn or stretch. They pay slightly different fees for the amount of time that they are standing vs sitting down. Some people are bankrupted by sleeping horizontally instead of vertically. Anything that provides comfort or convenience has arbitrary fees which go to the vault and not the other person providing the service (if any). Even relatively banal things: your partner and you need to pay an extra fee if you use the bed at the same time. Eating with a friend or stranger instead of by yourself cost almost twice as much so people tend to eat alone.

They need to pay a "resort fee" to pay for the Vault Gym which is never open or has weird operating hours such that only one or two people have ever been in there in the span of 30 years.

It is more dark if everyone in the vault is poor. No rich or class violence: just violence of "the system". Everyone is afraid to break the rules because they'll be put in stasis for a month. Every time there is a revolution against the status quo by the time the revolutionaries get back from their month in stasis, the culture+propaganda is stronger than before.

Fees are to be reconciled at the end of each day. There are also weird line-items like "Bonded storage fee", "Blowout preventer testing fee", "Byproduct disposal fee", "Batch processing fee", "Bunkyard fee", etc. Nobody knows what they are actually for but everyone pays them. The prices stay roughly the same but more and more keep being added as inflation goes up. They never are removed. Most of the money is removed from the economy so that people can't get rich from other people but people can have rich "lifestyles" by giving gifts and prestige: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moka_exchange

If anyone gets negative amount they immediately are put in cryogenic stasis for a month and their balance is reset to 0.
