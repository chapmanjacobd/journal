<p>Compared to what? If everyone was driving the <em>Makigai MaiMai P126</em> then the cars that you see as normal would be <em>really weird looking</em>.</p>
<p>Personally, I think a lot of big cars are really ugly. The <em>Range Rover Sport</em> looks pretty good but what's up with the <em>FJ Cruiser</em>??? what's up with <em>four-door pickup trucks</em>?? They all look really weird to me but also they look ugly</p>
