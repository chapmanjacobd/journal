<p>I recently set up an emulator for PS2 to check out the games in Recursive Repertoires. This site was really helpful for setting up:</p>

<p>For Fedora Linux users: The version of PCSX2 in rpmfusion is really old and doesn't support the high compression CHD format (that you can make with chdman of mame-tools) so I recommend just downloading the <a href="https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2/releases/download/v2.4.0/pcsx2-v2.4.0-linux-appimage-x64-Qt.AppImage">AppImage</a> instead.</p>
<p>Also for Wind Waker it <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DolphinEmulator/comments/qjlztz/wind_waker_gba/hiqzy9b/">looks like</a> having a recent version of Dolphin will help if you want to use the GBA integrated emulator</p>
<p>Also also, this page is a great resource if you want to check that the BIOS was dumped correctly: <a href="https://emulation.gametechwiki.com/index.php/File_hashes">https://emulation.gametechwiki.com/index.php/File_hashes</a></p>
<p>Also also also, there's <a href="https://www.psdevwiki.com/ps2/Sony_BRAVIA_KDL22PX300">a TV with a PS2</a> built-in to it?!</p>
