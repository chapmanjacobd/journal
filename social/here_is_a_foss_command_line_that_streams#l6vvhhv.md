huh! I'm surprised I haven't heard of this before. Interesting work!

Does VBML allow for multiple sources playing at the same time? It looks like [it does](https://github.com/omega-gg/VBML/blob/master/samples/track/multi.vbml)? I had a somewhat similar, or adjacent, idea before: https://unli.xyz/p/2017/YC_alt.cinema.pdf 

Might be interesting to explore more in that area: now that you have the content, how does Motion Freedom allow remixing content in novel (d√©tournement!) ways?

I also work on somewhat [similar software](https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/library). Adjacent to this but related enough! It is interesting to use on a large local collection of media where it is fast enough to search that ideas are mixed and combined--or playing random music and random muted video together, ie:

      --interdimensional-cable      Duration to play (in seconds) while changing the channel
      (-4dtv)                       --interdimensional-cable 40
        INTEGER                     -4dtv 40
                                    You can open two terminals to replicate AMV Hell somewhat
                                    library watch --volume 0 -4dtv 30
                                    library listen -4dtv 30
