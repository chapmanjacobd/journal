<p>It seems strange that dummy plugs have to exist at all. It seems like a software/firmware problem. Though I'm sure the economic value of an HDMI dummy plug factory, DVI dummy plug factory, VGA dummy plug factory, etc provide some needed jobs; I wonder if the environmental cost is worth it when a room full of application and firmware engineers could probably figure out a reasonable "force enable GPU frame buffer mode" solution in a few days or less</p>
