<p>Ah yeah Logitech Flow only works with specific Logitech mice and keyboards. It looks like there are also free alternatives to Symless:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/deskflow/deskflow">https://github.com/deskflow/deskflow</a> (this is upstream of synergy so it is free but it might be more unstable (think beta version) and potentially more difficult to install)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/input-leap/input-leap">https://github.com/input-leap/input-leap</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/feschber/lan-mouse">https://github.com/feschber/lan-mouse</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.inputdirector.com">https://www.inputdirector.com</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I haven't used these myself but they should all mostly work fine</p>
