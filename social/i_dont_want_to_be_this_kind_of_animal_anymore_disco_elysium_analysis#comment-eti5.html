<p>The Star Wars Hotel one? Yeah, that one was pretty good--but that didn't need to be four hours long either. It could be summed up as "person goes to expensive hotel experience but the pole blocks the view during breakfast, lunch, and dinner". Of course, the video itself is more entertaining than that...</p>
<p>This one is not as funny but my eyes got wet a few times. I think this video sums up the Disco Elysium experience well enough if you wanted to skip the 25+ hour investment of playing the game but it is worth watching on its own merits. If you know the game already you could skip large chunks of the video. The editing is very tidy and he doesn't bring up the same point over and over</p>
