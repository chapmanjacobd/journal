<p>If electricity is cheap for you, I would buy something that supports SAS drives like <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/176547574313">this</a> and then fill it with cheap SAS drives like <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/205608467330">this</a> (16TB for $40)</p>
<p>But if electricity is expensive... don't underestimate the extra yearly costs. Spending a bit more for a more energy-efficient array often pays for itself after a few years. I have an old 12-bay r730xd which uses around 300 watts while transcoding media--running 24/7 that's an extra $400 per year in electricity and I pay only $0.14 per kWh.</p>
