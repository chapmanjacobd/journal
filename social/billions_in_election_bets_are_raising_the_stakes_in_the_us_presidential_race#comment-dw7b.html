<p>viewed by whom? I have no doubts that the prediction markets of 2010 compared to 2020 are wholly different. The majority of these people are not integrative-thinking super-forecasters but more and more tending toward sports-enthusiast horse-betting crypto-bros who always have a Polymarket browser tab open. Not that these two groups of people are mutually exclusive...</p>
<p>edit: Also, this is another point to consider: <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/large-bets-election-prediction-market-are-overseas-source-says-2024-10-18/">https://www.reuters.com/world/us/large-bets-election-prediction-market-are-overseas-source-says-2024-10-18/</a> I know at least 3 Hong Kong people who have no real ties with the US but have spent a significant amount of money (&gt;$2K USD) on these markets. Their news sources are mostly wallstreetbets and lihkg</p>
