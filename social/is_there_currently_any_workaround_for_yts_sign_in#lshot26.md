I'm pretty sure I'm banned. Can't play videos if I'm signed in anywhere but if I switch to a private tab or use yt-dlp then I can watch the video. I think it's been longer than a month...

    Video unavailable

So far it's only affected my YouTube account but it's totally possible that I've been marked with the black spot just like Muppet Treasure Island

edit: it looks like I'm unbanned now. I guess it was about two months

Now I know to choose vimeo for any heimlich maneuver videos
