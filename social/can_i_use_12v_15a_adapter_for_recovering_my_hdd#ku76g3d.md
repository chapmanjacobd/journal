If the voltage is the same it shouldn't usually break electronics--but mechanical devices is another thing. 

If it was more than 2a you would be totally fine but with fewer amps the concern will be that the device is not getting enough power to work--in this case to spin up or maintain speed necessary to write files. If you can get the disk to spin up and write something it's probably fine to use for a few days without any major long-term issues / lifespan reduction
