shunning is a pretty universal human activity. I doubt it would need to be "re-taught"/re-learned but rather it is a natural extension of "don't let that bad guy back in here" or "we don't talk to those people because they broke the rules". 

When someone who aspires for power but does not fit with the status quo, perhaps someone who calls themself a "Sun-King" is born to the Nora's ancestor there will be a power struggle/awkward social clashes between the matrilineal society and this person/people. Eventually the "Sun-King" person will either integrate into the existing power structure or they will not be able to integrate into it and like our immune system there will start to be more and more barriers to prevent people from being annoying and disruptive of the superstructure which surrounds the base of power
