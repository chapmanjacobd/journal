Of course brands will always do branding but I wonder how many TiBs of CSS and JS code on the Internet are the result of the completely unacceptable default browser styles. 

I very, very rarely see people use it without it being satire--but plenty of people use the default Microsoft Word template. Not saying that these templates are interchangeable in style but instead fitness. The default browser style is essentially equivalent to Webdings and A3 as the default document size in Microsoft Word. Sure, it might work for some people but it's awful 99% of the time.

If it was common for browsers to offer some nice classless CSS styles for CSS-less websites I imagine a lot more sites would be simple documents. It is certainly possible for them to do this. They could even add automatic dark mode very easily. It does seem 25 years too late but perhaps if the finally fixed this it could inspire a renaissance of pure HTML energy.
