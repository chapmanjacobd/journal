<p>You can buy SIM cards in HK that effectively give you HK internet (I used one from HKBN; shows up as HK in ipleak.net and I had no problems accessing Google services) while you are in China--but I think 180-days is the longest duration that is available. I think the China Mobile ones also work similarly, when purchased and activated in HK.</p>
<p>I had no problems SSH'ing to various boxes from within China while on the SIM card or using different public WiFi networks. sshuttle probably works</p>
