<p>My last job was like this! Overall, a great experience but I imagine the quality varies more widely than larger companies. The environment can change a lot each time a person leaves or joins--but this is true on some level at larger companies too: one individual can make your life heaven or hell.</p>
<p>I think the added stress of working in a small startup is not worth it unless you are one of the founders. The workload can vary a lot too, depending on how management sees the company (are they planning a product pivot?, etc). Good leadership will know to not demand pointless busy work when they'll need all-hands-on-deck in the upcoming months.</p>
