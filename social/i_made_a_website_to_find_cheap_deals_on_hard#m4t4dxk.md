Thanks for the feedback! The US marketplace is updated every day and then the least recently updated marketplaces are updated _until I run out of API requests for the day_. Based on your feedback I'll prioritize Germany to be updated every day as well!

Eventually I should be able to switch to updates multiple times per day or maybe even real-time updates--it depends how many leads I generate to be able to increase access.
