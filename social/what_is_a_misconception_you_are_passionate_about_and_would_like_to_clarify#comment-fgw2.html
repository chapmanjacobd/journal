<p>I like math but I don't like rituals and social expectations that add unnecessary friction to everyday life. It fills me with existential dread--like doing the same thing over and over every day until you die. Prices should have all taxes, fees, and other externalities baked in. It's market failure when people are comparing two products and one has unaccounted externalities.</p>
