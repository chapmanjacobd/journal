<p>It's only gotten easier to be build PCs but it isn't really cheaper anymore. There are some deals and some not so good deals with both.</p>
<p>But choosing the best value or best performance parts, not just compatible parts, has gotten a little bit more difficult because there are either too many options or too few options. Simple example: you probably don't need a 1000w PSU and it will almost certainly be less efficient than a 500w PSU for smaller workloads.</p>
<p>CPU Interconnect speed, FCLK, etc has always been a thing but I'd argue that it's even more important nowadays to pay attention. Single thread speed has kind of plateaued and any frequency mismatches add up quickly. Buy a pre-build computer and they should have already figured all this stuff out for you--but unfortunately capitalism has made that not as much of a guarantee:</p>
