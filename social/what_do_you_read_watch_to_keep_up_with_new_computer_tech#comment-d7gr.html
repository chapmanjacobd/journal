<p>It's only gotten easier to be build PCs but it isn't really cheaper anymore. There are some deals to be had and some not so good deals with both.</p>
<p>But choosing the best value or best performance parts, not just compatible parts, has gotten a little bit more difficult because there are either too many options or too few options. Simple example: you probably don't need a 1000w PSU and it will almost certainly be less efficient than a 500w PSU for smaller workloads.</p>
