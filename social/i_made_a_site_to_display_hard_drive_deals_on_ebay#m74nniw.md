I made this for Canada: https://unli.xyz/diskprices/ca/

But note that almost all of the best deals ship from the US... It's a good C$50~80 difference per drive. But still this way you can filter out the ones that don't ship to Canada (they won't show up on that page)

Does customs usually tack on a bunch of fees?
