Similar to x265 vs AV1: it depends on your encoding settings and the specific type of scenes (action, dark scenes, anime, etc); but yes, on average I would say AVIF is better than WebP in terms of filesize and quality. But I've only tested around ten different types of scenes. Sometimes it was a wash but other times AVIF looked better and it was 20% smaller than WebP

AVIF is related to the AV1 codec: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVIF
