One benefit a Linux phone could provide (but I have yet to see it) is lowering the barrier to application development or scripting on the phone. Right now termux-gui seems interesting but it's kinda limited with what you can do due to Android security implementation but even more so because of gaps in termux-api (mpv Android app cannot interact with termux in the same ways that mpv x11 can interact with the shell on Linux).

But there could be similar tooling for scripting up performant GUIs on the device with only the touchscreen. There is definitely a niche of people that want customization but there is still a gap between ease of getting started / on-device bootstrapped / end-user application development. We're missing a visual shell--graphical representations of simple composable primitives without needing an IDE--unix pipes but for touchscreens. Sxmo is interesting but still hard for people to get started.
