<p>Last night I stumbled upon the movie <em>The Cow and I (La Vache et le Prisonnier 1959)</em>. Apparently, it was <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liste_des_films_num%C3%A9ro_un_par_ann%C3%A9e_en_France">the most successful film in France in 1959</a>. While I don't know modern French milieu, with only one review on Rotten Tomatoes and 1.7K IMDb ratings it seems like the movie has faded into relative obscurity.</p>
<p>There are thousands of films like this. Popular with your grandparents generation but now are mostly unknown. And one-hundred thousand+ movies which never reached that level of exposure.</p>
