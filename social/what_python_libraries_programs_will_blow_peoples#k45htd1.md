I have a tiny (~600KiB excluding tests) CLI tool which I named [library](https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/library).

I keep adding small features to it every week. I try to keep the code itself simple and whenever I find myself needing to program something I add it to `library` if I use it enough. So it has become a kind of opinionated swiss-army knife toolkit.
