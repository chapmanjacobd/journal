yeah that seems pretty realistic to me... accomodation in some cities in Japan can get pretty expensive if you don't book early or if you travel during Golden Week, etc. 

You'll likely overspend in the expensive areas and underspend in the cheap areas... that's just the nature of things but I think $50-$60 is a reasonable and conservative estimate for Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam

Indonesia can be really cheap but not in Bali. Philippines can also be very cheap if you stay somewhere rural like Antique, Panay. If you have a lot of free time you can extend your travels in cheap areas to "subsidize" the expensive areas a bit...
