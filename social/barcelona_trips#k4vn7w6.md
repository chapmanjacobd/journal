Yeah most restaurants don't open until 8pm. 

Arcano Restaurant opens pretty early at 6:30pm~7pm. A little expensive but I would say good value. They have a tasting menu for 37eu (minimum 2 people). I recommend it. 

Most restaurants you should book in advance if you want to make sure you can get in.
