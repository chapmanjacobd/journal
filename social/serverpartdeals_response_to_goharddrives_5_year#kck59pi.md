That is interesting to know. 

With half a million items sold it's not a small company. I can think of a few legitimate reasons why they might switch to a new eBay account... but Malaysian driftwood is kinda funny. Maybe they sell both hard drives and aquarium supplies.

I feel like it might be the case that a lot of these companies, SPD, Tech on Tech, GoHardDrive, etc operate roughly the same business model. But SPD's website is far better and GHD's website seems like it hasn't been updated in 5 years including the inventory. But GHD seems more active on eBay and with better prices than SPD. I think it's probably a toss up... 

I've bought from both of them before. SPD packaging was more professional and they included Kapton tape but maybe that was actually provided by WD and SPD just forwarded it (or because I bought an Ultrastar which has the 3.3v pin thing and the other drive I ordered from GHD does not need that). I haven't had to RMA any drive that I've bought over the years so can't provide any insight on the RMA process of either.
