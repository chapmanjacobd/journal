<p>Personally, I don't see the appeal of children. They're usually loud, have tantrums, are largely unappreciative until after-death-wherein-they-regret-not-calling-more-often, and they are expensive to take care of. Bring back the kibbutz. If I can impregnate the adult female human mammal specimen and not have that effect my life much then it might make sense to do so. But it seems like a financially and emotionally reckless thing to do at this time. My wife and I value our ability to sleep long periods without interruption.</p>
<p>If we had a solarium we would value the time we spend in there over the time that child-rearing takes but since we do not have a solarium we value our time thinking about building a solarium and other possible futures in place of child-rearing.</p>
<p>But children who grow up in communal environments like daycare or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibbutz_communal_child_rearing_and_collective_education#Family_and_relationships_with_the_parents">children's social centre</a> are perhaps not well-adapted for modern living. I'm not sure</p>

<p>Raise the standard of living for new workers. No unpaid internships. Minimum wage must be able to support 5 people if you want to target that 2.1 children per nuclear family with one parent working and one child-rearing (with a trip to Disneyland every 5 or 10 years (this is the cost of the 0.9 child))</p>
