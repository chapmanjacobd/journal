<p>Initially when I wrote my comment, I wanted to type $8k vs $80k because personally, I don't see a big difference there either. (But I didn't write that because it's not very realistic for some parts of the world like the Bay Area--$80k and $800k <em>should</em> be more universally indifferent--<strong>both</strong> should be in excess territory for any reasonable person who can learn to live within their means).</p>
<p>But I agree with you, there are many thresholds. There are many people on this planet that live on less than $2 household income per day. Their lives are not totally different from ours--but their neighborhoods, communities, and markets have options for them that allow them to exist at that level. In the US, the margins between excess and homelessness are often razor thin. I understand that perhaps it is not a universal aphorism but excess is not a universal thing either... it's all relative.</p>
