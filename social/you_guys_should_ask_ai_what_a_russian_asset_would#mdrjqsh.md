It's worth pointing out that any content filtering/selection (ie. restricting the time or provenance of something) doesn't really have an effect on large language models. It will attempt to match expected style but nothing more than that. If anything, it could bias the output in unpredictable ways. To limit it to historical information you need to use a model trained on historical data only.
