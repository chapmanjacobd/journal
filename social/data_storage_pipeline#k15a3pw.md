I have a daily script that runs on my phone in termux to move files (photos, downloads) from many different folders into a syncthing folder: https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/phone/blob/main/.shortcuts/tasks/syncthing.sh

I also use Google Photos and it is very convenient. You could organize locally with desktop software like ACDSee. But it sounds like once every few months is already reaching your limit of the time you want to spend manually curating things. You could automate some of this with ExifTool.

I have other scripts which automatically download from reddit, youtube, etc: https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/library 

For me, data hoarding is a separate scheme from data curation. If I like something a lot then I will add some metadata about it to a list stored in a github repo: https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/journal/tree/main/lists
