yeah it's a good start but since you already know Scala well then I would just look for articles which compare elm and haskell. I've found that a lot of those articles are well-written and provide deeper insight which I need to first understand something.

I would recommend just starting a project and seeing what you need from there. Join the Elm slack to ask for help. they are very active and helpful
