<p>2025-03-15: Judge blocks Trump from using Alien Enemies Act to deport five Venezuelan men â€” A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport five Venezuelans, implementing a temporary restraining order for 14 days. Judge James E. Boasberg noted that the ruling was to preserve the status quo amid concerns about the emergency powers invoked under the act. The Trump administration appealed the restraining order, arguing it would hinder presidential power before the act was officially announced. Litigation over the Alien Enemies Act raises concerns due to its previous use only during wartime, requiring a formal declaration of war.</p>
