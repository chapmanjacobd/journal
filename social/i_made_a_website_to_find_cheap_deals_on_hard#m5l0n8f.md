Thanks!

Unfortunately, I can't do that yet. The eBay API License has a very specific requirement that public display of eBay User IDs for deleted users must be removed immediately (even GDPR allows a one-month grace period). Once I am approved for the Feed API, I can revisit this and directly reference the User ID. 

But for now you can use the **Seller Rating** column to filter out sellers with large or small historical sales depending on your preference! 

But I _do_ realize this is a less than ideal stopgap: I'm not exactly sure why eBay displays different numbers depending on where you look. For example, Server Part Deals have 137K items sold on [this page](https://www.ebay.com/str/serverpartdeals) but then on [the specific listing page it has a different number](https://www.ebay.com/itm/305641833470): 10,471. The information that I use comes from the listing page
