<p>It's an unfortunate story but I think radiation in general is not very scary... It's just an invisible and very portable fire that you can't see or feel directly but can kill you. It exists everywhere at low levels but some rare places burn hot. Perhaps we live in hell surrounded by small invisible flames--but probably not. But if you live somewhere a long time it might be good to check for radon and radiation in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kramatorsk_radiological_accident">building materials</a>.</p>
<p>Thankfully the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_civilian_radiation_accidents">list of global incidents</a> is pretty short--though that could simply be because it's not the first thing people think to check</p>
