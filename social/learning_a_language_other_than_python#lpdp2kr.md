Coming from Python, Rust only took me a couple hours before I was feeling productive. The built-in tooling like `cargo check` makes it really easy to see what is wrong with the syntax and fix it.

That being said, my ten hours with Rust haven't really made me think in Python differently. Maybe I understand variable shadowing and local scope a bit more but even those things do not translate 1:1
