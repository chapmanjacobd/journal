Yeah I mostly use `nano` and `git` in Termux. I'm comfortable with using the git CLI and for my journal specifically I wrote a [small script that writes the git messages for me](https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/computer/blob/main/bin/wip_message.py) so on my phone I just type "[wip](https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/phone/blob/main/.config/fish/functions/wip.fish)" after editing multiple files and it all synchronizes. Merge conflicts are very rare if you push and pull often.

but I admit that isn't for everyone! I'm sure there is a nice GUI app. It looks like these two might be good:

- https://gitjournal.io/
- https://spck.io/

I'm tempted to try gitjournal out. Or if anyone else has text editor recommendations that would be useful.

edit: Xed Editor is pretty good for editing multiple files at the same time. It has Termux storage integration--but no git directly.
