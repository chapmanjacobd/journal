Is there a way to select all the text in the kitty terminal or copy the output of the last command without rerunning the command and piping to xclip?


edit:

I figured it out

1) Ctrl-Shift + Home

2) ctrl+shift+alt+left triplepress

3) (press End or space to scroll to the bottom) shift+right press (clicking the rightmost bottom area)
