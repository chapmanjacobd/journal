<p>This is an initially bizarre experience but it could actually be somewhat useful once you get a hang of the controls.</p>
<p>You have two buttons: "Paint" and "No". Press "Paint" if you like what you see and "No" if you don't.</p>
<p>edit: The site is not completely without bugs. For example, there is a caterpillar. But also they don't handle CORS correctly when clicking "save" so it will just hang forever.</p>
<p>edit: the <em>Painter Stories</em> section is also pretty interesting. You can get to it by reloading the page and clicking the upper right area</p>
