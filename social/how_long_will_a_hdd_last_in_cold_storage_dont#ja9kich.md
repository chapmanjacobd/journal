It probably won't make that much of a difference either way.

A spinning disk does not cause as much wear as constant start and stop, but at the same time, hard drives are designed to eventually rest every so often. I believe firmware is sufficiently advanced nowadays that you really don't need to waste time thinking about how to optimize for durability. They do all that [science](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.4978639) for you. 

As long as the drive is used (or not used) within relatively normal operating conditions how long a drive lasts is mostly randomly determined, a lottery. I would bet that a hard drive which is not used will decay in subtly different ways but ultimately it won't matter that much.

But if you aren't planning on using the space--by the time you need it you'll buy a high-capacity drive like you say--I would be more concerned with the cost of power for the duration of the drive's lifetime vs the lost opportunity cost of not using the space
