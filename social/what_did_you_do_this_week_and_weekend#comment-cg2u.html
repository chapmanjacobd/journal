<p>This week I went to China and visited Shenzhen and Guangzhou. There's this moderately popular chain fish restaurant called Taier (太二) and they have this really delicious pickled "sauerkraut" fish dish. I also ordered a cute plush fish keychain (4CNY; about $0.5 USD) with my meal and it came with two fairly substantial bags of cat food (maybe 1kg total). Apparently, they give out free cat food to anyone that walks by the restaurant and shows them the keychain--although I tried to do that at the location in Macau and they didn't know what I was talking about so it seems like it is only a mainland China thing.</p>
