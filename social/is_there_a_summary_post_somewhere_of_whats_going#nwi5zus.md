Yeah the [instructions](https://github.com/Martchus/syncthingtray/blob/master/docs/android.md) of Syncthing Tray don't inspire much confidence... I'm sure it works well on desktop but the Android functionality [seems more like an experiment](https://github.com/Martchus/syncthingtray/blob/master/docs/android.md#caveats-on-android) which is why I didn't mention it above. It seems worse than just running Syncthing via Termux and accessing settings via http://localhost:8384 in the phone's browser

I am curious what it looks like though... shame that they don't include any screenshots anywhere
