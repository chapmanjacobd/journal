<p>As soon as it was realised that the GBS was sinking, order was given to evacuate the platform. All 14 persons got off the structure safely and unhurt, getting help from near-by vessels and boats. From onboard the vessels, they witnessed how the concrete structure was sinking and disappeared under water about 18 minutes after the initial "bang".</p>
<p>The water depth at site is between 170 and 220 meters. By means of a remote operated vehicle the remainders of the concrete structure were found over a wide area of the muddy sea bed.</p>
