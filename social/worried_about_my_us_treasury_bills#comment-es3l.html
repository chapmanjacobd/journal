<p>This is conspiracy theory territory but Putin has had his eyes/heart on the collapse of the dollar since the 2000s:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even as a full collapse may be difficult to achieve, they can benefit from any partial destabilization they can induce.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We believe that a new phase is coming in the development of human society. All will collapse—both Europe and America, and the U.S. dollar. It’s a matter of time. By the way, if the dollar collapses, after that crashes the old world order.”  — Yuri Shalyganov</p>
