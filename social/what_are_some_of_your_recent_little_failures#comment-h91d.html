<p>I've done something like this before but I was too lazy to move the monitor across the room so I ordered a HDMI to USB-C cable to use my phone as a monitor. Surprisingly, it worked! But it requires special apps like <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=infinitegra.app.usbcamera">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=infinitegra.app.usbcamera</a> which uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_video_device_class">same protocols</a> that webcams use.</p>
<p>Then a few months later I broke <code>/etc/security/limits.conf</code> on a server that I didn't have physical access to as it was all the way across the world. This broke <code>sudo</code> and a lot of other things so I couldn't edit the file again. The normal services that the server was running were working fine but I spent two weeks trying to fix it when I had a new idea. <code>pkexec su --session-command</code>, etc... Nothing worked until I discovered that <code>systemd-run</code> somehow bypassed the problem: <code>systemd-run sh -c "cat fixed.conf &gt; /etc/security/limits.conf"</code></p>
<p>A little while after that I locked myself out of ssh and had to ask someone to type in reverse mapped colemak (as the system keyboard layout wasn't set to qwerty) into a virtual console...</p>
