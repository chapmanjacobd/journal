You have three CLI options:

1. Write the playlist and channel URLs in a text file and do `yt-dlp -a urls.txt`

2. Write a batch or shell script invoking multiple calls to yt-dlp with different config options

3. Use xklb to build a SQLITE database and download from the fetched metadata: https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/library#getting-started
