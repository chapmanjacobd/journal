<p>I've been <em>playwatching</em> <strong>Watch Dogs</strong> and the character motivations are flawed but the story is still reasonably enjoyable. The stealth game mechanic (hacking cameras and/or telling people to move around) feels pretty unique--especially in the cases that you can complete a goal by only partially entering a building (going from camera to camera instead of walking around).</p>
<p>Last week I played a few games of the card game <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/291453/scout"><strong>SCOUT</strong></a>. You're a ringmaster and you're poaching acts from other circuses... except all the talent are reduced to numbers... it's a pretty simple game but I feel like it is funner than something like UNO even though you use similar strategies to win.</p>
