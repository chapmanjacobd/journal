<p>Yeah, I'm leaning more into the mini-split idea. I contacted a few electricians today to see how much it would be for them to add a disconnect box. I could probably do it myself but I'd rather have someone insured be the one drilling holes in the wall.</p>
<p>From what I'm reading online it seems like doing an energy audit is also a worthwhile endeavor. If my house was more insulated I think I'd be fine with 12k BTU but right now I'm leaning slightly more toward 18k BTU. 12k is probably the right size (a bit oversized for the 380 sqft room but slightly undersized for the whole 675 sqft house). But I'm a bit worried about extreme weather events and it not being powerful enough to keep up with all the air bleeding--though I suppose at that point I could patch up the house or get 1 or 2 window air conditioners again so I should probably just get a 12k BTU mini-split</p>
