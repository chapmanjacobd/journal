ah I hadn't seen this type of page before--must be new--but yes it works with xklb. I just tried it. 

Here are the links: https://paste.mozilla.org/GoovvNcx

edit: Looks like the Internet Archive is not giving all the results when scrolling the page. You could try running it a few times with different sorting options. For example, running xklb links twice and then remove the duplicate links:

    https://archive.org/details/@mxr-recorder/uploads?sort=-addeddate
    https://archive.org/details/@mxr-recorder/uploads?sort=addeddate
