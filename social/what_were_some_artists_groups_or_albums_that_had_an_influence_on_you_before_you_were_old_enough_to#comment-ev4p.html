<p>On long car trips my dad would play the same <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfheqbqoGGg">CSN</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/6u4hQpOOSyY">Cat Stevens</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiVVJu5gX-M">The Mamas &amp; the Papas</a>.</p>
<p>My dad would always get irate at the music my brother listened to like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efa6BAWPm9o">R.E.M.</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hLESLXqBLI">Led Zeppelin</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzvk0fWtCs0">the Grateful Dead</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/EDqKtaE50yk">Johnny Cash</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3QDDlWmR9Q">Depeche Mode</a> so by the time I was old enough to choose my own music I was scared to make the wrong choice.... Looking back, I think it was mostly other factors that made him angry but I associated these sounds as a source of conflict.</p>
<p>I was heavily influenced by Pandora and Grooveshark. I think I was one of the first and youngest users of both sites from 2003-2013. They exposed me to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiWOpg0n57g">Vampire Weekend</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/ryPMDdPB9DQ">Simple Kid</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6wT_6uEiRk">Sufjan Stevens</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6XcI384y8k&amp;list=OLAK5uy_m4Lt-3lsotfdhRWa6KQKde6X8_erfM9ko">Jason Lytle</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_wmAlQkrXA&amp;list=PLgR8BSl9a3jaW09HXLOfzGhoHvhCxj36V">SebastiAn</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiV50X8xjSM&amp;list=PLQvL6GLJiX9346giKhdoGcsfl_1w419qa">Röyksopp</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV4msjRe1wk">of Montreal</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ShtkY7CCY">Sébastien Schuller</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=use8dcTn4tI&amp;list=PLsOURxfjP4d1-4-YzzSUET2yp4q4GwFZ9&amp;index=10">RATATAT</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVUcIc0DEZA&amp;list=PLMOWqPiYPhSE4xURGbh-4QiUKsD7kDM6L&amp;index=3">James Blake</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cla-Smdic_k&amp;list=OLAK5uy_nBQQN4JNnt3ISFXwSY-1kjlr8Er_P5soM&amp;index=2">The Dø</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sfYpolGCu8">Phoebe Bridgers</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsjsoy8sPvs&amp;list=PLiN-7mukU_REyKvKlRJMwGjsNCamUhqpd&amp;index=6">Moondog</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH01veDUQOk">Jackson C. Frank</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQ7HWgbOucE">Arnold Rosner</a>, and <em>a lot</em> of other acts. I guess I didn't really feel <em>overly</em> comfortable with any specific music so I hit the randomize and next button a lot.</p>
<p>I think my brother originally listened to the Grateful Dead because he saw the cover had a skull and knew that would piss my dad off so he checked it out of the library for that reason. He wanted to rebel because it gave him a sense of control. I'm able to look back and appreciate both my brother's and my dad's taste in music but the conflict between them was traumatic for them and everyone near.</p>
