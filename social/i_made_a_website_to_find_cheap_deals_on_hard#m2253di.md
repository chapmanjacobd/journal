For sure, excluding bathtub curve failures I expect used drives to not last as long as new drives. 

That being said, there are thousands of 4TB SAS drives that are selling for under $5/TB... cheaper than most LTO. Of course, only time will tell whether modern hard drives can last as long as tape [when stored in the right conditions](https://post.bytes.com/forum/topic/software-development/757826-magnetic-decay-in-modern-hard-drives?p=4966663#post4966663).
