I agree that 'Wrap' is useful for quick and dirty automatic line wrapping but if you are relying on it too much you might be doing layout design / desktop publishing rather than spreadsheeting.

If you care about the text layout then you could get a better effect by using 'Clip' and/or 'Merge cells' with manual line breaks.
