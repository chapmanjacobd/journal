<p>Power supply efficiency is an inverted U curve. Peak efficiency is usually between 40% and 80% load and smaller loads (0-40%) usually have steeper efficiency dropoffs vs. overloading (80-100%)</p>

<p>My own PC has a decent GPU and 8 HDDs but load (measured by my UPS) is usually between 200-350w. That might be lower than you might expect. I don't use all the W's that <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/thermaltake-smart-bm2-750w-power-supply-review/5/">my PSU</a> is capable of. Maybe PSU efficiency doesn't really matter very much while electricity is cheap but my main point is that higher numbers are not automatically better. You need to think about the system holistically when choosing parts</p>
