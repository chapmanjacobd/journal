Interesting. I hadn't heard about 'Shrink to Fit' before. I would need to try it to know if it is superior or not but it sounds like you'd end up with a lot of small font sized text. 

I mostly use Google Sheets. This makes me wonder if there are other text wrapping modes which haven't been invented yet. Î”

Perhaps a mode could exist where text size stays the same but there could be a visual indicator of how much text was clipped out--and the cell cursor could change shape as it moves around switching from 'Clip' mode to 'Wrap' mode.
