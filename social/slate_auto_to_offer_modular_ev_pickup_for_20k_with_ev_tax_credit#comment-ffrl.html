<p>Huh... that seems kinda counter-productive. It's a lot cheaper for society to not need to build 500kW delivery capability to all the houses everywhere rather than a couple hundred spots around town. Is it just that the electricity delivery is classified as spontaneous rather than sustained? Or is this just price gouging?</p>
<p>I would think this would be a good time for electricity companies and governments to work together to figure out a long-term plan which helps the current incentives match up more closely to the long-term situation.</p>
