If the encoder is the same in the source application (or device) and the transcoding application then the output should be the same (or slightly worse depending on the decoding)--but if the encoder in the transcoder has higher quality settings the output could be higher quality given less strict runtime constraints (ie for a live recording or shooting video in a camera the encoder needs to run at least 1x speed on the given hardware)
