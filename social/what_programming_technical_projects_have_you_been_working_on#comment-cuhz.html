<p>U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) does not issue visas. USCIS belongs to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The National Visa Center (NVC) is the part of the Department of State (DOS) that performs some pre-processing tasks for visas on behalf of U.S. embassies.</p>
<p>All US visa applicants (non-immigrant and immigrant) undergo consular processing so it makes sense that the DOS is the one that is tracking and publishing the statistics. <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/green-card/green-card-processes-and-procedures/adjustment-of-status">Adjustment of Status</a> allows some nonimmigrant visas (issued by U.S. embassies) to be used when applying for permanent residence (and a few <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/travel/international-visitors/visa-waiver-program/requirements-immigrant-and-nonimmigrant-visas">Visa Free</a> asylum seekers). Of course, it is <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-7-part-b-chapter-7">more complicated</a> than that...</p>
<p>That being said, I think USCIS does a better job of publishing DOS policies.</p>
<p>edit: in some sense you are correct. There is potentially a better source for the data that I am interested in. I didn't catch the note at the bottom of <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/visa-law0/visa-statistics.html">this page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Report of the Visa Office does not contain information on these categories:<br/>
Refugees entering from abroad or asylum-seekers in the United States or<br/>
Non-numerically controlled visa categories for people in the United States who are adjusting status (getting a green card or becoming a permanent resident) through the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services in the Department of Homeland Security (USCIS).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But this information seems to contradict the visa categories. Immediate relatives of U.S. citizens are not subject to <em>numerical limits</em>. I assume these limits are the same as "non-numerically controlled". Certain <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/ohss/topics/immigration/lpr/classes-of-admission">classes of visas</a> are only allowed for Immediate Relatives of U.S. Citizens (eg. IR1, CR1). The data in the Report of the Visa Office includes these visa classes. Odd. I guess the important qualifier in that note is "<em>in the United States</em>"--although to be in the US in the first place you would need to first get a non-immigrant visa (which is included in the report) or not have a visa (visa free or unauthorized border crossing).</p>
<p>You are correct to point out that the Office of Immigration Statistics (OIS, under DHS) includes data for these people who fall through the cracks</p>
