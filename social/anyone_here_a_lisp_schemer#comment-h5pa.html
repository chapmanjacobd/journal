<p>I've played around a few times but it never really clicked for me in terms of figuring out what it is best at. I feel like scheme is a really good educational tool for learning how to design languages and getting people to think creatively about hard problems but as a tool itself I'm not sure when I'd use it when I could use <code>golang</code> (totally different I know but the standard library is written really well it makes a lot of systems programming footguns melt away--just try it for a day or two if you haven't).</p>
<p>I think LISPs work really well for interactive scripting environments: competing with JavaScript or Lua. But of course you can do anything with anything--this is just how I feel.</p>
<p>You might like the <em>Future of Coding</em> slack community (which was renamed to <em>Feeling of Computing</em>...). People share lots of baroque and esoteric ideas which are often thought-provoking. Mariano Guerra provides a weekly digest newsletter of the "best of" discussions each week if you prefer email:</p>
