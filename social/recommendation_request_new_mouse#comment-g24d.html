<p>I guess they fixed it--mine is still going strong even after six years... but Logitech has since <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Trackballs/comments/ll4gew/has_the_logitech_trackman_marble_been_discontinued/">discontinued the TrackMan product line</a>; 4 years later they still have stock that they sell on Amazon... but the price is much higher than normal. I guess it is all old stock</p>
<p>Supposedly the Microsoft Trackball Explorer is the holy grail of trackballs but alas it also is discontinued... Elecom also <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Trackballs/comments/h06yco/dont_buy_the_elecom_deft_pro_why_do_people_still/">seems somewhat well-regarded</a>. I'd only recommend it if you like to tinker:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fun with Elecoms is modding it until all the annoyances are gone ðŸ˜‰</p>
<p>I stuck with zirconia in my Deft Pro for a few weeks, the stiction never really went away. Finally got annoyed enough that I opened it again and replaced with chrome steel bearings, much better! Will need to deal with the tricky disassembly if steel bearings wear flat, but that's a small price to pay for usability.</p>
<p>The bearing holders are too big for the replacement bearings, that causes the rattle. I think rattle would actually exacerbate the stick-slip behavior; I cut up some small pieces of electrical tape to pad the bearing holder so bearings remain stationary.</p>
