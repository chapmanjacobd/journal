<p>There will never be another moment like the one where you watch <em>Nathan for You</em> for the first time and for the first few seconds you don't realize that it is satire. The deadpan vocalization and other tropes are nothing new but they fit the current social climate so well, or at least the one that existed ten years ago.</p>
<p>It's a contradiction. It's hard to imagine <em>Nathan for You</em> ever being <em>fully</em> surpassed by something else--but I think it is also possible that it could be fully eclipsed by another piece of media in less than 100 years (yes even with a weird joke about drinking grandson's pee or an identical replacement--maybe people don't pee in the future). There is nothing "new" that will be in that media either. All the tropes will be the same. But the content will be slightly tweaked to fit the social climate of February 2113. It will be a hit. But it doesn't really <em>need</em> to exist. We already have <em>Nathan for You</em>.</p>
<p>There's far more content than you might expect being "created" (ripped) straight from "unknown" books and films from the 1930s--and even more than you might expect from "unknown" authors to established authors of the 2010s. <strong>I don't have a thesis here.</strong> I'm just writing to think through all of these things. Regurgitating facts and beliefs. Trying to string these ideas together to find a conclusion. To make something novel. Revealing the truth by forcing conflicting ideas together... or maybe that is what divining rods do.</p>
<p>I'm of the opinion that it's very difficult to make something truly new. Mutation is mostly accidental and it can only happen through reproduction of source materials. Our dreams are multiple experiences that our brain extrapolates upon, combines, or compresses down. Everything expires. Everything dies. Reproduction is required.</p>
<p>Harry Potter and all the Harry Potter knock-offs are fungible. Especially in another 50 years time. Not all of them can exist. We will forget at least one. All of the good mornings eventually blend together into one good-morning idea. Even more than routine, "good morning" becomes convenience. What makes one day's "good morning" better than the other? Maybe one morning you were saying "good morning" while watching Ben 10 and another morning "good morning" you were signing up to start your own Minute Burger franchise? It's the context that makes the "good morning".</p>
<p>Given what you say about Shakespeare's unoriginality it may be the case that the act of consolidating, reproducing, and thus preserving folk stories from his time is the bulk of his value as an artist. But I agree that there is also value in making inaccessible media more accessible. Either by making the story more relatable or by "unlocking" the highbrow-only locked metaphorical closets. But maybe this is just another aspect of preservation and not really adding much.</p>
<p>For fungible films and <a href="https://harpers.org/archive/2025/01/the-ghosts-in-the-machine-liz-pelly-spotify-musicians/">fungible music</a> the deviation is undesired. That's not to say that all music or all films are fungible. No! It's not a currency. Some content is certainly more fungible than others. Are there people really out there buying copies of Tosh.0? Probably not many. They just watch it and immediately dispose of it. But hey they're still making new episodes of <em>America's Funniest Home Videos</em> so I'm not sure what to think about all of that. Distribution and marketing is a big part of the reason why people are watching something over something <em>equivalent enough</em>. "They" pay lots of money to put the best-seller book on the table next to the door so that the book can become a best-seller.</p>
<p>Here's some of <a href="https://unli.xyz/jakscoproductions/">my art</a>. There's a reason why I haven't had one email from one person who desperately needed it. Art is largely fungible. I like to think my art is somewhat unique. Maybe most of it is trash but at least with toilet paper people were attacking each other to get a piece during the COVID times.</p>
