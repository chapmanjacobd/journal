<p>I really like the <a href="https://forums.woot.com/t/logitech-marble-mouse/1922907/2">Logitech Trackman Marble</a>--and the wireless M570 to some extent.</p>
<p>After a couple years of use the M570 seems to need more and more frequent "<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=nose%20grease%20m570">nose grease</a>" and I did have an issue with one of them failing to reliably click and drag after a couple years of use but the one that Logitech sent me as a replacement is working fine and it has been three years</p>
<p>It probably just makes sense to expect to buy a new one every couple years even if you buy more expensive ones</p>
<p>Here are some finger trackballs that are relatively cheap:</p>
<ul>
<li>$34 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YVMXLQC">Kensington Orbit Trackball Mouse</a></li>
<li>$39 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Trackball-Rechargeable-Adjustable-Connection-Compatible/dp/B0BKLGJPQT">Nulea Wireless Ergonomic Trackball Mouse</a></li>
<li>$29 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DHSDQKHD">PORLEI Wired Trackball Mouse</a></li>
</ul>
<p>edit: for what it's worth--I bought the Nulea to replace my M570 and have been really enjoying it</p>
