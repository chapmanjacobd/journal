There is already a minimal seller feedback filter in place so you shouldn't see any zero-rated or low rated (feedback percentage) seller items. 

Filters like these don't prevent sellers from selling unrelated items for a bit and then switching to more expensive items, ie. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brushing_(e-commerce). 

However, given the eBay API License's specific requirement that public display of eBay User IDs for deleted users must be removed immediately (even GDPR allows a one-month grace period), I believe it would be simplest to reference the seller rating instead of the seller name in the short term. Once I am approved for the Feed API, I can revisit this and directly reference the User ID.
