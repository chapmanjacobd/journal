<p>Code on the Go is a standalone integrated app development environment that makes it possible to build applications on older, low-end Android phones, even in locations without Internet access. The app, documentation, and reference materials are free, self-contained, localizable, and easy to share.</p>
<p>On the foundation of our IDE, we’ll develop or adapt additional Android app development tools that make it easier to code using a phone’s small screen and soft keyboard.</p>
<p>We will work with NGOs, governments, educational organizations, and other partners to support effective localization, distribution, training, and educational materials to bring computer science and app development to underserved regions and communities.</p>
