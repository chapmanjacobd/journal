<p>at least for NPP, the last update was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad%2B%2B">1 day ago</a> so it doesn't really make sense to say it is older imho... old programs for me means not updated and you're forced to turn on compatibility settings</p>
<p>If they were of same complexity, NPP should be more complex than heavy IDEs because it's had longer to grow in complexity. But its goal is to be lightweight, first and foremost, so simpler feels like a better descriptor than older</p>
<p>But lightweight or IDE-lite is an even better way to group these programs</p>
