My point is that it shouldn't matter whether behavior stems from culture or individuality. You will treat him differently because he follows or doesn't follow cultural norms? I think that is a mistake. Just treat people like people. 

Try to be understanding of everyone--not just because they come from a different country but because they are an individual who is entirely separate from you~
