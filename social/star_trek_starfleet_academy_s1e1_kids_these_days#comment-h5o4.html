<p>I can't hear the dialogue because I just hear <em>Mike Stoklasa</em> of RedLetterMedia saying "That's not Star Trek" and weeping</p>
<p>In the first few scenes the character motivations and reactions just feel completely off?? I don't know... I can't really get into it. It doesn't help that all the dialogue is awful too</p>
