React will be overkill unless you're planning on working with a team of people or you're creating an interactive web app but even then I'd recommend starting with Elm because it's much easier to learn by yourself because the compiler will give you helpful tips. And you can insert the Elm components inside of React if you ever needed to transition to working with a team that is only familiar with React.

Express.js is pretty good for APIs. Just run it with Nginx in production
