<p>You just reminded me of the time that I ordered a big, meter-wide, <em>rice paper pendant lamp</em> because it was $4 several years ago. It's probably a fire hazard but I put a halogen bulb inside that and it was like having a big ball of sun hanging in the middle of the room.</p>
<p>I think a DIY solution here might be a cheaper and more reliable option. Combine a smart plug with something bright. But it's also nice to have color temperatures change throughout the day. I have something along the lines of <em>2-in-1 Smart LED Flush Mount Ceiling Light + Backlight, WiFi, Works with Alexa,Google Home,12 Inch 2000 LM</em> and it is bright enough for me but I probably don't have SAD</p>
