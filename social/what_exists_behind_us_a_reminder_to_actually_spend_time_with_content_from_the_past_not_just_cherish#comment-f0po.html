<p>There's an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_McCloud_episodes">episode of McCloud</a> where they are running around this big computer room trying to hunt down some information about a killer and it is beautiful. Just running around to different dot-matrix printers.... I don't remember exactly. But you couldn't quite reproduce that in a remake. No one will have any idea why they're using a printer. Maybe it didn't even make sense at that time either but no one really knew what computers were back then either.</p>

<p>I saw a chart recently that showed the number of unique titles available on different streaming platforms vs piracy and the difference was like ~2,000 vs ~200,000. It's a terrible thing but also amazing that people don't notice how small streaming libraries actually are.</p>
<p>Also, it makes me realize that Netflix is a lot more like Aldi's than WalMart. Things are swooping on and off shelves faster than you can watch it...</p>

<p>In January 2007, the company launched a streaming media service, introducing video on demand via the Internet. However, at that time it only had 1,000 films available for streaming, compared to 70,000 available on DVD.</p>

<p>If that's true then the Netflix VOD library has only doubled since its inception... not enough people noticed that it is at least 35x smaller catalogue than in 2007.</p>
