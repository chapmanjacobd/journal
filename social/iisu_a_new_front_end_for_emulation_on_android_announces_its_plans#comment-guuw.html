<p>The first time I saw WiiFlow I didn't believe it. The design was too good. It seemed like a scam. It hit <a href="https://youtu.be/jb_PnOrzYA4?t=112">all the right design notes</a> that any young <em>WAD Manager</em> enthusiast could yearn for in the early 2010s...</p>
<p>I haven't used it personally but <a href="https://www.launchbox-app.com/android-download">Launchbox</a> runs on Android and it looks pretty good! Different aesthetic though</p>
