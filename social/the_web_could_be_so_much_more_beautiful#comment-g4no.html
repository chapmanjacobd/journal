<p>I just tried it out and it <em>is</em> interesting. Reminds me of newsprint.</p>
<p>Wikipedia looks incredible with <code>text-align: justify;</code>. The blockquote. My godt! They should immediately adopt this.</p>
<p>However, hyphenated words are less scan/skim-able. That may be one rea-<br/>
son why it is not widely used anymore. People might gloss over an impo-<br/>
rtant word. It's interesting to see that even the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/">NY Times site</a> does<br/>
not use this. I guess the site is mostly pictures now and not real news.<br/>
Do they even print real papers anymore?</p>
<p>I'm what you would call a young whippersnapper so I'm used to ragged lines of text already. I prefer the even distances between words. Equidistant spaces. The tradeoff is losing that and it is not worth it. But large blocks of text in the Wikipedia context... it is curious that they don't use it. It really does look better but it is slightly less readable.</p>
