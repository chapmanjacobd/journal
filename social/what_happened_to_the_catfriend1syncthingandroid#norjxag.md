You can actually run Syncthing via Termux but features like autostart and battery optimization are not as integrated.

I had good luck with Termux:boot and crond but for some reason one day it stopped autostarting. maybe it would work fine in a fresh install though? If Syncthing-fork stops being updated that's what I'd try
