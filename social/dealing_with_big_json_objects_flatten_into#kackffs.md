You might want to first try https://github.com/cube2222/octosql

If you need something generic you could look at https://github.com/tulip/relationalize or you can take a look at this [nosql_to_sql](https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/library/blob/main/xklb/site_extract.py) function which I wrote last weekend. 

But you'll get best results by hardcoding something specific in Go, Rust, or Python. I've used this library in the past for these types of things: https://pypi.org/project/orjson/
