<p>I think it depends how you define science-fiction. There are a lot of books/stories that take place in a science fiction <em>setting</em> but they use fantasy (magic) to resolve tension. Star Wars is a famous (and often debated) example of this.</p>
<p>There are also a great many books that don't take place in a science fiction setting but they use science to resolve tension. I think <strong>Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality</strong> is a good example of this. It is a good balance between funny and thought-provoking:</p>
