<p>The bit about the wolves/wall was indeed interesting but i can't help but feel like he pads out the videos in order to be at least 10 minutes long so that he gets more YouTube money and the title of the video is a bit click-bait.</p>
<p>Still, thanks for sharing! Just wish I spent two minutes instead of twenty or so</p>
