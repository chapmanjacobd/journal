I've always been curious about this but none of the videos I found on YouTube provided me with satisfying imagery.

If I, an average-sized human, were an HÂ²O molecule, what is the area of space that is a skin cell or the area of space of another human?

Is a country big enough to be a cell? Or the Earth? Is our solar system large enough to fit one human at that scale?
