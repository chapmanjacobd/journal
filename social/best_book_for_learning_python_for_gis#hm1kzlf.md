How is the above advice requiring a level of knowledge of Python? My advice is basically a BASH script.

 If you only need to automate QGIS then you can use BASH and it's a lot easier to setup the environment. Or you can use fstrings for string interpolation in Python as a quasi-BASH script

And how does someone "know" python? There are so many things in python that I have no clue of. I wouldn't say I "know" python either. I have no patience to set up pyQGIS. trying to setup pyQGIS is the most alienating and dissuading experience I've ever had. never got it to work on windows
