<p>Perhaps another way to phrase this would be to ask how much money would you need so that you aren't worried about the future (excluding any income or other investments you may have)?</p>
<p>In order to make this question even simpler and more relatable, instead of money let's use time: the amount of money that you would need to live one day:</p>
<ul>
<li>one day of buffer</li>
<li>one week of buffer</li>
<li>one month of buffer</li>
<li>two months of buffer</li>
<li>six months of buffer</li>
<li>one year of buffer</li>
<li>ten years of buffer</li>
<li>thirty years of buffer</li>
</ul>
<p>It's likely that you'll only know this answer through experience (at the very least having enough to pass the first threshold of "enough" and feel relief) and you might change your answer after being unemployed for more than a reasonable amount of time. Both of these things require passing thresholds.</p>
