<p>Yeah my tool will skip OCR if the document already has selectable text (if the file claims to be PDF/A compliant). ocrmypdf has these options as well (and my tool passes the same flags to ocrmypdf, when provided):</p>
<pre><code>OCR options:
  Control how OCR is applied

  -f, --force-ocr       Rasterize any text or vector objects on each page, apply OCR, and save the rastered output (this rewrites the PDF)
  -s, --skip-text       Skip OCR on any pages that already contain text, but include the page in final output; useful for PDFs that contain a mix of images, text pages,
                        and/or previously OCRed pages
  --redo-ocr            Attempt to detect and remove the hidden OCR layer from files that were previously OCRed with OCRmyPDF or another program. Apply OCR to text found in
                        raster images. Existing visible text objects will not be changed. If there is no existing OCR, OCR will be added.
