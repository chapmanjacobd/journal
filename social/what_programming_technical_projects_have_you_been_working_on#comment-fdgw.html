<p>That may very well be the case. I wonder what the actual overhead is... It's quite common for scanned books to be 30MiB or even 90MiB PDFs. Losing formatting and pictures you could bring these down to 300KiB. If they are picture books then maybe you could convert each page to AVIF and end up with 5MiB. There will be a noticeable loss in quality but it may be worth it to be able to have everything on one 8TiB disk.</p>
