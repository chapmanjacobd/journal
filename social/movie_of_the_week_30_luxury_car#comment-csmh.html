<p>I was able to find a dead torrent by searching the original title 江城夏日. But yeah even if I search on the Chinese private trackers I don't see anything (admittedly there are hundreds and I can only search a few).</p>
<p>Even searching the film on the US distributor's site does not show it in its catalogue--though that is par for the course in my experience</p>
<p>Looks like in the US it is still available on Sling if you search for it: <a href="https://watch.sling.com/dashboard/search/1/asset/d36428a71604db94b3eb3bd3059c8f3f/browse">https://watch.sling.com/dashboard/search/1/asset/d36428a71604db94b3eb3bd3059c8f3f/browse</a></p>
<p>The first half of the film (44 minutes) is on DailyMotion--second half nowhere to be seen. Although it is available at <a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/jiang-cheng-xia-ri-voiture-de-luxe/oclc/458310435">178 libraries</a> and on the <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/xm8d6kgwxvjll9?hl=af-ZA&amp;gl=US">Microsoft App store</a>....</p>
