hmmm... ok.

  


what it be okay if it showed the price cost in percentage? for example, let's say for Seoul it would say that the cost is made up of 55% food, 10% local transport, 35% hostel.

  


I'm just thinking how I can show the data without having a massive block of numbers which aren't easy to compare across 3000+ destinations
