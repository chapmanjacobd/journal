<p>"I made a map of the Internet. It is incomplete. You won’t find links to social media sites, big corporations or advertisement renderings. In fact, most of the Internet is missing from the map. Hence, it is more accurate to describe the map as My Internet or the Naive Internet Universe." – Kristoffer Tjalve</p>
<p>A project by Kristoffer Tjalve and Elliott Cost. Made in Athens in November 2023.</p>
