It looks like they don't accept returns for pocket coils: https://latexmattressfactory.com/pages/return-policy

I checked some other stores:

- No returns allowed: https://diymattress.com/product/pocketed-coil/
- Returns seem allowed within 60 days: https://diymattress.net/products/caliber-edge-6-pocket-coil-by-leggett-and-platt
