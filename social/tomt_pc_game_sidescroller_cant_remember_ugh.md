I don't remember it being an older game. Possibly made with java. Sidescroller where you break into places and eventually you break into this lab place. I think the game is an indie project, but I don't remember the title.

Edit:

It's Trilby. Trilby: The Art of Theft https://archive.org/details/Trilby_The_Art_of_Theft
