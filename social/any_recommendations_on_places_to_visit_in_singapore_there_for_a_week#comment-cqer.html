<p>The National Stadium is a nice place to walk around and get some exercise.</p>
<p>I also second the recommendation of trying out hawker stalls every day for lunch. Tons of great options everywhere. Don't be afraid of Indonesian or Malaysian food... Ayam penyet is really delicious. Nasi pecel (peanut sauce) is also quite good.</p>
