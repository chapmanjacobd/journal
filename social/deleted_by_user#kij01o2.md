Someone has probably done this before already and published it. I would search GitHub/GitLab first--at least then you might get some ideas for how other people are doing this.

At the very least I imagine that you'll be able to do a StreamIO or FIFO (to stream the download directly to the person downloading it, like a proxy) instead of downloading to a temp file.
