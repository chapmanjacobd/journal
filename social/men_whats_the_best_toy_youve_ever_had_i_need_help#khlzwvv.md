The OTouch Chiven (and Airturn to some extent) is surprisingly good. Easy to clean and unique feeling. It takes a while to learn how to use it the right way though

But yeah fleshlight is really the best. Stoya Destroya is a good overall texture. Still, the OTouch has a different feeling. Sometimes I'm in the mood for one or the other or something else
