probably a problem with the gyroscope or magnetic hardware of your phone. does it happen when you put it somewhere specific in your car? try putting it in the plastic cupholders instead if it'll fit to see if that fixes it.

  


it's also possible that your phone doesn't have a gyroscope or magnetic hardware and that recent versions of gmaps are built to not be backwards compatible with limited hardware
