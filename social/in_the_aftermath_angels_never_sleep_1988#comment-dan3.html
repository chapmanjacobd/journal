<p>This film re-uses clips from an animated film (Angel's Egg--the studio acquired rights in a distribution bundle) with replaced sound. The film does a good job at telling a different story from the original film while still copying some thematic tropes. I had low expectations of this film and I was surprised by how cohesive it was. If you haven't seen Angel's Egg definitely watch that first... and then maybe a month later watch this.</p>
<p>It's kind of weird to see Oshii listed as the writer of the screenplay (in Wikipedia and IMDb). I guess they get away with this by listing the other screenplay authors as "Additional Screenplay" in the credits. They also put the original Angel's Egg credits as "Production Crew Japan"--I am doubtful that few, if any, of the original "Production Crew Japan" knew about this or had any say in it. I don't know of any other movie that is a re-edit to such a large extent... it's almost like a fan-edit but this one is more legal in some sense (lawful neutral vs chaotic neutral??).</p>
<p>I would give <em>Angel's Egg</em> a solid 7/10 and <em>In the Aftermath</em> a weak 7/10. They are both unusual and daring films but in very different ways.</p>
<p>I would be interested to know of any similar films, where:</p>
<ol>
<li>A substantial portion (between 20% and 60%) of the film is re-used footage (video or audio) from another film</li>
<li>It doesn't re-hash the same story (there is at least some re-interpretation or loss of context)</li>
<li>It is released under a different title (as opposed to a Special edition or Director's cut re-release under the same title)</li>
</ol>
