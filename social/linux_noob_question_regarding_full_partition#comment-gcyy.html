<p>Flatpaks are pretty space hungry because each one might depend on a different FreeDesktop environment so that's like 1 or 2GB per app lol...</p>
<p>30GB is still very reasonable for a non-GUI system. Lots of space for user files too. But for GUI... each program can be pretty big. If you have something that depends on Gnome, depends on GTK+, something that depends on KDE, depends on Qt... then you have a lot of dependencies that can be large in aggregate. So maybe not that different from Flatpak in the end.</p>
<p>I would say 50GB is reasonable for a GUI system. But if you use something like Btrfs subvolumes or LVM partitioning then it's not so painful when you realize that you need slightly different volume allocations</p>
