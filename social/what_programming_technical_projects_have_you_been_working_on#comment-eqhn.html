<p>The first time I tried duckdb it was very slow (around 2020-2021). So I ignored any articles about it because it just seemed like marketing fluff. But recently I tried it on a few different things and I've been blown away.</p>
<p>So this week I'm taking a closer look at it and seeing if I can completely replace SQLite in my projects. If so, it should be pretty easy to write a function that upgrades any existing SQLite databases to duckdb. I don't think duckdb supports multiple-writer processes though so I'll probably still use SQLite for at least a few things</p>
