<p>I second the recommendation of <code>scoop</code>. It's not as fancy as <code>choco</code> but simpler is more reliable.</p>
<p>Recently I had the (dis-)pleasure of being forced to use Windows. But with scoop, msys2, clink, nushell, and wezterm it isn't that bad. It feels more responsive and less hacky than something like WSL. Of course it doesn't have everything but sometimes I forget I'm using Windows</p>
<p>I uploaded some configs here: <a href="https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/computer/tree/main/.github/Windows">https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/computer/tree/main/.github/Windows</a></p>
