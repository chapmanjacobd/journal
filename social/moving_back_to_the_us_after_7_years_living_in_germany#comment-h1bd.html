<p>How much stuff are we talking about here? Definitely shop around on shipping costs (FedEx, UPS, DHL, EMS, freight...) vs bringing four pieces of luggage. It's more annoying to ship stuff because US Customs makes you itemize <em>everything</em>.</p>
<p>Get rid of large stuff unless it has a lot of sentimental value. Allow yourself to keep the small useless stuff. Make tradeoffs between them to cut down on the total amount of stuff.</p>

<p>There's not much that you actually <em>need</em>. Make sure your passport isn't expired and that your luggage isn't overweight. Don't worry about other things but also make the most of the time that you have left in Germany as you probably won't be back for a while! Do the Germany bucket list. I think that's the most important part (or if there's any paperwork that you need to do that you can only do in Germany)</p>
