<p>I mean that just because the stop is there doesn't mean that it is used. The frequency of use for a given stop is not uniform across all stops. So removing a bus stop makes little difference if it is a rarely used one.</p>
<p>Here's another case: sometimes there will be a person at stop C and other times there will be a person at stop D and the bus only stops once in either one. This is a fairly common situation for these kind of semi-urban too-many-stops situations. Removing stop C or stop D just makes it less convenient for one or the other people.</p>
<p>My point is that comparing these types of stops to European ones may be comparing apples to oranges as the density is different and many US bus stops may be these sort of ephemeral stops where it isn't really impacting anything.</p>
