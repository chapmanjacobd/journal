<p>IINA is mpv for Mac OS. You can use mpv on Windows and Linux too. Unfortunately, when you restart your computer you will start over... unless you find <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CogentRedTester/mpv-scripts/refs/heads/master/keep-session.lua">a lua script which can keep track of that session history</a> or use <a href="https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/library">a program</a> that I wrote!</p>
<p>It keeps track of the number of times you watched or listened to something.</p>
<p>First install and create the file database:</p>
<p><a href="https://scoop.sh/">https://scoop.sh/</a></p>
<pre><code>scoop install mpv ffmpeg python  # or use choco

pip install library
library fsadd audio.db --audio .\Music\ .\Audiobooks\
</code></pre>
<p>Then you can use something like:</p>
<pre><code>library listen audio.db --where play_count=0 --random
</code></pre>
<p>That will play things in random until you've run out of things to play.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, you can add <code>--fetch-siblings each</code> and that will make it so that files within each parent folder are played in order (for example ep1, ep2, etc). You can also use <code>if-audiobook</code> instead of <code>each</code> to only play in order when "audiobook" is part of the file's path.</p>
<p>For videos the process is essentially the same. But use --video instead of --audio and watch instead of listen. You can also add --fs to force full screen.</p>
<p>You should exit with ctrl-c when you want to stop and mark the video as incomplete or <code>q</code> to mark the video as watched and go to the next video.</p>
