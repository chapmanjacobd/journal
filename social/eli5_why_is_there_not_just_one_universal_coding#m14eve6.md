> the huge loss of computing efficiency

It's a bit of both. Mainframes have tight integration with hardware while other platforms like Linux or Windows programs are more portable. It's difficult to do a meaningful apples-to-apples comparison.

I agree that COBOL excels at what it does because of its tight integration with both hardware, people, and business. That is, part of what keeps COBOL alive is also IBM sales methodology. The largest differentiator of Mainframes/COBOL is that it is typically sold as a complete system. A bit like Apple computers are. The only secret sauce that COBOL has is tight integration. This is the same for Apple. They control the hardware so they can throw in an interesting chip and know that the hardware will support it. There isn't really anything preventing [other computers](https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/) from being as performant as a Mainframe, except that people seem to reject monolithic architecture.
