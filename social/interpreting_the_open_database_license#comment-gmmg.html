<p>I think this specifically is the wrong conclusion--you were right before. Their use of ODbL is wrong because they treat it as a <em>content</em> license but the purpose of the ODbL specifically relates to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_right">database rights</a>.</p>
<p>Actually, they even disclaim certain content rights because much of the content is public domain. While they have certain database rights due to the effort they exerted to file FOIA, data processing, etc--but at the same time make it as difficult (or perhaps even moreso difficult) for you to compile the same data (from them or due to their prior actions)--in some sense their use of ODbL on the small subset of data that they give you doesn't actually apply at all--unless you got the full or substantial portion of the database from them or someone else under that license.</p>
<p>Facts are public domain. That doesn't mean that they are required to distribute them freely--they can hold the data like a trade secret--but that behavior doesn't really sound like the spirit of free and openness! They should put the data on BigQuery or S3 requester pays.</p>
<p>But all this contemplating doesn't really matter because judges, lawyers, and laws often contradict themselves and it often seems the case that whoever has the pointier stick, wins--and, depending on your country, ODbL may not even have any legal standing (other than via contract law). <em>Sui generis</em> Database Rights are only recognized in a small number of countries.</p>
