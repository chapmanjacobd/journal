<p>On Windows it may even be slightly harder to get started because it's not obvious where is the correct place to download the ISO. Things have improved somewhat but even on the official page there are three different download buttons and a lot of technical jargon without much explanation as to what arm and x86 is. Though if you buy off the shelf I guess it's easier as it includes a burned USB already? (Assuming the USB works with every CPU architecture)</p>
<p>In both cases you need to figure out how to boot into UEFI which can be pretty daunting to do on your own if it's your first time as every motherboard manufacturer does things slightly differently even between motherboard models.</p>
