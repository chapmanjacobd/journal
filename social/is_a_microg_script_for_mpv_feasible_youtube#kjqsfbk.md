You can use `--mark-watched` in yt-dlp

#### ~/.config/mpv/config

    ytdl-raw-options=cookies-from-browser=firefox,mark-watched

or maybe

    ytdl-raw-options=cookies-from-browser=firefox,mark-watched=true

ahh but partial viewing progress is not this. still, this might solve half of what you want
