<p>My brother would always listen to Johnny Cash. He passed away and I put all the music he made online: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVoczRgDnXDIyx3-NQ3AVdPOh7xbS_20s">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVoczRgDnXDIyx3-NQ3AVdPOh7xbS_20s</a></p>
<p>He was never a guitar virtuoso but I would describe his music as modern folk. He has a couple songs that are worth a listen (the first song has a long intro).</p>
