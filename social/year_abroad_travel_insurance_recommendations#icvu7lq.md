look for comparison sites like Squaremouth. I was able to ensure my 3 month trip for a very low price. I think it was like $30 with a reasonable deductible.

But one thing to keep in mind is that a lot of variables determine how much the insurance companies will want to charge you so if you have time it might be worth it to figure out that you should go with x company for one section of your trip and y company for a different section.

Also, read the fine print. Many contracts stipulate that you have to leave your domicile on the same day that the insurance starts, etc.
