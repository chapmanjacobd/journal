<p>st is not particularly fast but it is simple (or maybe you're talking about startup speed? rather than throughput/render speed). Modern terminals like the ones you mentioned (and <a href="https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot">foot</a>) do more things to be faster.</p>
<p>So the problem is pretty much isolated to the program that you are typing into. There is probably a bug in that</p>
