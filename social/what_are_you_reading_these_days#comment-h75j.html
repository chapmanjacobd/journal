<p>I've been reading this strange pamphlet, <a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-invisible-committe-to-our-friends">To our friends</a> by the <em>comité invisible</em>. Anarchist and libertarian writing is often nonsense but sometimes it is philosophical and so inapplicable to everyday life that it brings in an interesting perspective which allows you to see things in a new way.</p>
<p>This is in contrast to conservative writing which has a total lack of philosophy but is very applicable to everyday life and I'm proud to read these approved books! <em>The Holy Bible</em> is a solid coherent foundation for a form of government. It fails in boring ways where anarchist text fails in interesting ones.</p>
