<p>I'm surprised no one has mentioned TongFang. I've been pretty happy with the Tuxedo Pulse 15 which is based on the TongFang PF5NU1G.</p>
<p>The keyboard feels a bit cheap but everything else is great</p>

<p>But this specific laptop is already 2-3 years old. It's still running great. Plenty fast. But not sure what the latest equivalent of this is</p>
