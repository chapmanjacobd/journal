Cool! Nice to see some competition ;-) jk. Interesting tool...

Two observations/questions:

> NSRL database is approx 5.3 GB

It really downloads a 5 GB file just to scan? I wonder if you could bring that size down... seems big

> UUIDs

It might be nicer to have something human readable for session IDs. Maybe hostname-ISO_timestamp ???
