<p>While I agree premium monitors are worth the cost, I am very skeptical about whether dark mode really is "the best" for legibility and reducing (daytime and/or nighttime) eye strain.</p>
<p>With AMOLED/OLED, "Perfect Black" is very cool and my beef is not with AMOLED/OLED at all--although because you are already invested into technology which has this very specific benefit you probably won't find what I'm about to say very interesting or persuasive as it would be a waste to not use "Perfect Black" as the primary display color on OLED.</p>
<p>I don't want to be prescriptive about this. Rather, I only encourage people to not conflate aesthetics with readability and to not accept the dark mode/light mode dichotomy at face value. I challenge the idea that dark mode is best <em>through</em> its absolute minimization of the amount of light. But also, light mode is not better either. Almost anything is better than a 3000 nit blaring white screen.</p>
<p>My main idea is that, given the same lighting conditions and healthy eyesight, both high contrast and low contrast are poor for long reading. The key is localized medium contrast. Perhaps with pitch black background, instead of white text and UI elements, maybe try silver or gainsboro or light grey. Maybe you are already doing this.</p>
<p>Also, I guess you are probably already kinda doing this if you have something like <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/KDE-Night-Color-To-X11">Night Color</a>/F.lux/Redshift which changes the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/set-your-display-for-night-time-in-windows-18fe903a-e0a1-8326-4c68-fd23d7aaf136">color temperature</a> automatically at night. Although I wonder how much of a difference there is in legibility between global and localized luminescence / color contrast.</p>
