<p>I recently read <em>Gold: The Final Science Fiction Collection</em> which is a collection of short stories and articles by Isaac Asimov collected posthumously with a forward by Orson Scott Card.</p>
<p>The book itself is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_(Asimov_book)#Contents">split into three parts</a>. The first part is fifteen short stories. The second part is essays about science fiction--most of these seem to be forwards for other short story collections--there is some repetition but still enjoyable. The third part is essays about writing science fiction.</p>
<p>The structure of the book is a bit unusual but very satisfying. It felt like an appetizer and I'm craving more. Luckily, I haven't read many Asimov and he's written over four hundred works. I've been concurrently listening to the audiobooks for <em>Nemesis</em> and <em>The Gods Themselves</em> and feel like my head is about to explode. I've been enjoying both stories a lot but I should probably slow down.</p>
