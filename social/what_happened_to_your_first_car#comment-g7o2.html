<p>My dad re-commandeered "my"* 2001 Mitsubishi Montero to give to my older brother. After a few months he trashed it during a heroin binge and it was impounded. I don't really remember being that mad I just thought the whole thing was really stupid.</p>
<p>* I might've contributed $500 to its purchase but I don't think I paid for the whole thing.</p>
