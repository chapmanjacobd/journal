<p>Cables run like tentacles into the different rooms of my house from one relatively powerful computer. It is a bit <em>Beneath a Steel Sky</em>. I have custom global keyboard shortcuts that I press to switch to another room. Each room has at least one "station" with a keyboard (usually K400 or similar) and a monitor or TV.</p>
<p>When I use my laptop or phone I'm usually connected to it by ssh, nomachine, or freerdp.</p>
