<p>Huh... TIL. I always thought postgres views are mostly transparent to the query planner but that is not always the case:</p>

</ul>
<p><a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/materializations">dbt</a> (a common tool in the Analytics Engineering community) often favors using views:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Generally start with views for your models, and only change to another materialization when you notice performance problems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But this is mostly for OLAP workflows which run a handful of times per week where the performance difference might not matter or might not immediately be obvious.</p>
<p>The speed difference between INT4 and UUID index lookup can be over an order of magnitude in really long and wide tables. Luckily they aren't usually that bad: <a href="https://ardentperf.com/2024/02/03/uuid-benchmark-war/">https://ardentperf.com/2024/02/03/uuid-benchmark-war/</a></p>
<p>However, I absolutely agree that UUIDs are pretty awful, even as external IDs: they aren't great for debugging as they are hard to visually compare (you might think they are the same but your glance only compared the first and last 2 chars, etc). You can't even double-click-select them because they have dashes. And users definitely prefer smaller IDs like "BOB123"</p>
