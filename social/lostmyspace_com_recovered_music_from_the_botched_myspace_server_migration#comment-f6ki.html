<p>From 2003 to 2012, Myspace was the premier place for bands to post their music. In 2018, it lost it all in a botched server migration. The Internet Archive has managed to get their hands on a collection of nearly half a million songs, and has made them available in a searchable interface. Please enjoy exploring the collection below.</p>
