<p>I tried spinning up Pepsiman a couple months ago in anticipation of this month and my wife recognized it. Apparently, her dad played it all the time in early 2000s Hong Kong!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I'm still stuck on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IT2eORvwo">Stage 2</a>. No other game has made me feel like I'm in Captain Beefheart's band and he wants me to deliver him a coke in polytempo time--maybe I just need to mute the audio and not think about it like a rhythm game</p>
