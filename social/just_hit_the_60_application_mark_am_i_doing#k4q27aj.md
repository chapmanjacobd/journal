> two of the three where Iâ€™ve been a final round candidate have been those sorts of positions

I would just keep applying to positions that you feel you would be happy to work at. Don't waste time applying for jobs out of desperation. 

Redirect that marginal energy to tailor your resume just a _little_ bit more for the specific jobs you are looking for. And research the company just a little bit more and do mock interviews just a little bit more. It sounds like you'll land something soon!
