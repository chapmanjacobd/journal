<p>I'm not sure when this one was made or even if it was written by me? I think may have been an early interaction with LLMs in 2022?? From an unsaved tab in VSCodium (I use VSCode 90% of the time but keep around VSCodium for random notes and snippets):</p>

<summary>The Mojave Desert through the Eyes of the Minarchist.txt</summary>
<pre><code>The Mojave Desert through the Eyes of the Minarchist
The game starts off in almost perfect balance
Each faction tolerates each other
fighting
but never killing off each other
Then you start the game and you throw it all out of balance
The Mojave is pretty unforgiving
but if it's one thing
it is fair
It doesn't choose sides
But at some point while playing the game Fallout: New Vegas
you have to choose sides and effectively take over other factions
Almost ironically
progress in the game can be seen as regress through the minarchist lens
Throughout the game you meet over fifty different factions which you can be accepted by or vilified
In order to complete the game you must either side with one of three major factions at the expense of the others or you can side with an AI named "Yes Man"
reprogram a robot army
and take over Hoover Dam so that no one faction has more control over the other
The last option would be good
but it stems more from dictatorism than minarchism
The big problem with Fallout: New Vegas is that many of the quests you can complete for factions are against other factions
This is not necessarily unlike real life
but it denotes a false sense of progress
If the player sides with "Yes Man" they can fail to see through an illusion of egalitarianism wherein the player him or herself has defeated every main faction and has effectively become a powerful dictator
This is unfortunate given the vast number of factions within the game
the level of ideological exploration was both illusionary and lacking

<p>I probably wrote it 3 months ago at 4am and don't remember</p>
