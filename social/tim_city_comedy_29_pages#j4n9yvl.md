The ending is really funny and unexpected. I think you could lengthen some scenes and add a subplot to make it a 70 or 90 minute film. As-is, it feels too dense for a 30 or 45 minute episode. Maybe it could work in an anthology series with hour long episodes like Black Mirror.

Overall it feels a lot like Free Guy (2021). Not sure how you would have CP in the movie. The idea of the FBI training a bunch of epileptics and making special helmets for them and then send them on a mission to rescue someone from a terrorist group is funny but I think having CP so integrated in the plot will make it unpalatable for a lot of people--even if this was an animated movie and they are all LEGO people running around.

edit: I think something that might be useful to explore more is Tim's life before he sees a homeless man having a seizure. What's Tim's job? Why was he specifically targeted by this religious fanatics--other than being able to "see the truth"? There could be some additional things there...

Also, the Doctor characters are really funny. The lines land well. You could have them show up more in other scenes. Maybe Tim is one of the first patients in an experimental trial to incorporate criminally insane people back into society
