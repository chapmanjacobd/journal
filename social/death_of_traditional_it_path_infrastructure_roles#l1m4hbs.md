I feel like there are different types of companies.

Many startups outsource IT (or just shadow IT) but they still need "DevOps" to productionize client-facing products and internal tools

But for larger companies the cost to have in-house IT is cheaper and has benefits that outsourcing does not have--as well as moving off-cloud.

There are just as many differences as there are overlaps between DevOps and traditional Sysadmin roles but many skills are related and interchangeable
