It looks like it's included in the same GTFS feed. Probably a problem on this page: https://www.miamidade.gov/global/transportation/open-data-feeds.page

Huh I just found this:

> Thereâ€™s inconsistency between the Miami-Dade Transit GTFS and what routes are actually being serviced. As a result, there are at least 40 routes that do not appear on any well-known app like Google Maps or MDT Tracker. Coordination between municipalities and the county is poor, and many municipal trolleys have routes changed or added without the change being reflected in GTFS. In this case, real-time data from TSO Mobile and ETA Transit must be used and factored in for trip planning.
