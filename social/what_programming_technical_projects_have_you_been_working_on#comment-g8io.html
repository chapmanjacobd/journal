<p>I've <a href="https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/library/commit/07798733826b9411608e65e794a879f24541888a">been tweaking</a> my disk-usage script.</p>
<p>I noticed that my published version isn't counting subfolders correctly and the immediate children vs recursive statistics are not clear cut. It's kind of a mess.</p>
<p>Google Gemini has been teaching me prefix trees (trie) but I'm not totally convinced. Counting subfolders is more accurate now but I still feel kinda bleh about it. I'm thinking of starting over again... but it is mostly working. I think I'll start over and not worry so much about doing too much within each loop and just make a big quadratic time loop but it will be simpler and easier to understand</p>
