<p>It should be footnoted that the author, Ozy Brennan, is not someone completely outside the rationalist community and that they have <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Ozy_Brennan">over a decade of presence</a> within and surrounding these communities and are not necessarily an independent and unbiased voice. They are themselves a self-declared rationalist even while the article itself is written in a more objective <em>etic</em> tone. This fact does not completely discount what they say (nor their interviewing) but perhaps this article should be read with the lens of the LDS church doing damage control investigating and evaluating the RLDS church, or vice versa.</p>
