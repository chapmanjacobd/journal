<p>I hadn't heard of Said the Whale before but it sounded pretty good a couple hours ago and I wanted to share that feeling. It's really as simple as that!</p>
<p>After hearing this song a couple hours ago, I took a listen to the rest of <em>hawaiii</em> and it was pretty satisfying. I agree the track <em>Resolutions</em> is pretty weak in retrospect--especially the ending: a fade-out but it is not even the last track and the fade-out doesn't even sound completely intentional. Terrible.</p>
<p>But in isolation... it is a nice short introduction to Said The Whale. It got me listening to the rest of the album.</p>
