I really don't think that's how derivative works are evaluated in the court of law--nor how wage theft and similar things are evaluated. That's like saying there is no legal claim because someone else briefly touched the broom-handle after not paying the janitor.

It would be easiest to handle this case as a contract dispute. Even if there was no formal contract written, there are likely informal emails or similar evidence that could be used.
