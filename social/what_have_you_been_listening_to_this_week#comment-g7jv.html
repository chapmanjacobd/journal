<p>I recently discovered <strong>Ariel Kalma</strong>. Wow! Big catalog covering a wide variety of genres.</p>
<p>I'll start you off with something familiar but saxophone: <a href="https://youtu.be/dvtzJMpsw0Q">Moonlight Sonata</a>.</p>
<p>If you liked that maybe try his <a href="https://ariel-kalma.bandcamp.com/album/moonlight-suite">Moonlight Suite</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1983 I moved from Paris to Hamburg to live with my sweetheart. I bought a 4 track ¼” tape recorder and composed Moonlight as a suite of vignettes illustrating Shamballa, the land of silence and bliss. Nightingale Records needed a new age version (Rainbow), so I added birds to the mix when they published a cassette (I was not satisfied with the sound quality). Then I left for Hawaii, raised a son and did not remix and remaster until… 2018. This time (almost) no birds.</p>

<p>Or perhaps you'd like something <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ENuR8Nn8aU">more modern</a>? Or something <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HvQwYVNF5k">more raw</a>? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f6dalmLkVM">New Age</a>?</p>
<p>Here is a documentary about him: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTk6LZfp9tY">Ariel Kalma - An Evolutionary Music</a></p>
