<p>hmm... it took a number of false starts for me to find something that works <em>for me</em>. Everyone has different preferences. So I doubt that this is 100% transferable to you, but I hope that you'll try:</p>
<p>I haven't read it, but I imagine the book <em>Atomic Habits</em> would say something like, "change your environment to make the easy thing your desired thing"...</p>
<p>Or maybe the <em>Tao Te Ching</em> says something like "be like water. or be like earth: paths typically emerge as convenient shortcuts where more deliberately constructed paths take a longer or more circuitous route, have gaps, or are non-existent. Once a path has been trodden out through the natural vegetation, subsequent traffic tends to follow that visibly existing route (as it is more convenient than carving out a new path by oneself), and the repeated trampling will further erode away both the remaining groundcover and the soil quality that allows easy <em>re-vegematation</em>. Eventually, a clearly visible and easily passable path emerges that humans and animals alike tend to prefer".<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desire_path"><sup>[1]</sup></a> But I haven't read that either.</p>
<p>I think to develop a habit you have to make it fun, especially in the beginning. After a week or two of consistent effort, and after you feel satisfied with the structure of your note-taking, it makes sense to backfill your notes from other sources but only if you do so <em>incrementally</em>.</p>
<p>Unless you can get it all done in one day it doesn't make sense to spend &gt;2 hours on it per day. Cron, or <a href="https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/computer/blob/main/.config/fish/functions/systemd-cron.fish">systemd-timers</a>, can be helpful for creating habits. Over the past two years I've been gradually adding <a href="https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/computer/">my whole Linux home directory</a> into git one file per day. As part of my "<a href="https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/computer/blob/8b535e8aa6c3607c52907dd5c29dec9e51ae65be/.config/fish/functions/daily.fish#L3">daily cron</a>", a line from the bottom of ~/.gitignore is removed.</p>
<p>As long as you keep the amount of work small, it's not too annoying to see that a one or two things need to be checked and <a href="https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/computer/blob/main/.config/fish/functions/wip.fish">committed</a> to git as I use the computer throughout the day. Maybe you could call this "microdosing work", "gamified labor", or "quiet quitting" /s</p>
