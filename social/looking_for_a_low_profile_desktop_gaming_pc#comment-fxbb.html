<p>Would a cute mini build ... be able to handle a game like that?</p>

<p>What I do is as I'm comparing options I will google the CPU model and see what the underlying iGPU chips are and find benchmarks that compare with dGPU options.</p>
<p>For example "AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 igpu" --&gt; I find <a href="https://www.amd.com/content/dam/amd/en/documents/partner-hub/ryzen/amd-ryzen-ai-9-365-vs-intel-core-ultra-battlecard.pdf">this spec pdf</a> and see it is Radeon 880M. Then I google "Radeon 880M Killing Floor 3" and I don't see a blog post or video that directly addresses it but I do see a video that plays the game with 8 different GPUs and I google different combinations of something like "gtx 1650 vs radeon 880m" until I find that GTX 1050 Ti is <a href="https://gpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/AMD-Radeon-880M-vs-Nvidia-GTX-1050-Ti/m2332825vs3649"><em>somewhat</em> comparable</a> in performance to the Radeon 880M. If the quality of the <a href="https://youtu.be/DOzFYwUO6lM?t=1277">output</a> is acceptable--it will render something similar just fine. But if you are sensitive to low fps then you'll probably want something that is a bit better than Radeon 880M for that game.</p>
<p>For me, I'll sacrifice some resolution and fps to increase other quality settings. 1080P and 24fps vsync looks just fine--but other people will disagree or they'll rather tradeoff something like FXAA instead of TAA so that they can render 4K or 100+fps, etc.</p>
<p>As long as your settings are dialed in, most video game "lag" comes from either asset streaming from storage or network latency. If the video pipeline can't keep up it will just drop a frame here or there.</p>
