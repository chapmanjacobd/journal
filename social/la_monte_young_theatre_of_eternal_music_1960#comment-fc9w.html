<p>This one starts out a bit like noise music but it really grows on you if you let it fade into the background--I think this might be one of my favorite finds of the year</p>

<p><small>If you don't like this you might like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eej1K-VCRv0">Composition 1960 #7 - to be held for a long time</a> instead which is perhaps a bit more notable. And if you like that but want something more modern maybe try <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZUqiwqh1pk">SebastiAn - Threnody</a>--or play all three videos at the same time if YouTube will let you</small></p>
