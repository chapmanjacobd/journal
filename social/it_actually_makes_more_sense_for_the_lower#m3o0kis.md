For me, it's because you have more rights after you've entered the aircraft, at least that is the case in the US. If the airline hasn't scanned your ticket and there aren't enough seats then you probably aren't going on the plane:

> Once a passenger has been accepted for boarding or has already boarded the flight, airlines are not permitted  to require that passenger deplane, unless the removal of the passenger is required by safety, security, or health reasons, or the removal is due to the passenger’s unlawful behavior.
