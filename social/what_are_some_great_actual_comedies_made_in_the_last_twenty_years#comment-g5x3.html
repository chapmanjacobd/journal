<p>Surreal comedies are often quite funny--even foreign ones as normal comedies usually rely more on cultural references or taboos. But you are right, there doesn't seem to be as many non-arthouse surreal films being made compared to 30 years ago. But maybe you haven't seen some of these:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All's Well, Ends Well (Hong Kong 1992)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instant Swamp (Japan 2009)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Holy Mountain (Mexico 1973)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There's also genre satire films like <em>Hot Fuzz</em>... <em>Everything Everywhere All at Once</em> (2022) and <em>Poor Things</em> (2023) were popular ones made recently.</p>
<p>But you are right... while there are films that try to copy the <em>Baby's Day Out</em> formula, the Three Stooges, etc... most of them are just not that good compared to what they imitate so they don't become widely distributed. Maybe you could try The Onion Movie (2008) or MacGruber (2010)?</p>
<p>If you don't like any of these... what are some of the older comedies that you consider comedies?</p>
