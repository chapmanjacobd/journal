<p>I've seen Breathless (1960) which Truffaut wrote the original concept for.</p>
<p>I think Day for Night is trying to convey the absurdity of cinema. A script for a film (in this case the movie within the movie) tries to be profound but even the unscripted lives of the actresses and actors are more profound.</p>
<p>Some of the examples that come to mind are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>SÃ©verine breaks down during an early scene. The few lines she says "out of character" are more vibrant and emotional than the scene itself--"I don't understand you Alexander! You've been peculiar, lately".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The swimsuit secretary scene. Things are planned out long in advance and also changed on a whim.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The love bungalow / cat scene. Sometimes scripts have really esoteric things going on. Sometimes montage like this is worth the extra effort / luck to film but a lot of the time it's just vapid nonsense that wastes the crew's and the audiences' time. What is the cat offering that scene?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tub butter is not in the script but it is the most necessary item. Absurdity meets real life. Re-molding the sticks of butter into tub butter is the most believable part of the film--and it is not in the script as the film makes it clear.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Some memorable quotes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>She hated the way we shoot movies - in bits and pieces! I remember escorting her to the premiere of her first big Hollywood movie. A fantastic evening! When the film ended, she sat there, then turned to me and said: "I did all that? All I remember is the waiting."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The film is really good at showing the pressure, planning, and time-tables that filmmaking requires.</p>
<p>The director's flashback to taking off all the Citizen Kane posters is really funny--there is definitely a <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/lasting-riddles-orson-welles-revolutionary-film-citizen-kane-180977625/">Welles connection</a> here.</p>
<p>It is interesting that <em>F for Fake</em> also came out within the same year as <em>Day for Night</em>. Both films have a similar level of craft and polish.</p>
