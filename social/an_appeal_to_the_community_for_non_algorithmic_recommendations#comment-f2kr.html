<h3>Articles</h3>
<p>Instead of recommending specific blogs which often vary in quality... I'll tend to recommend articles.</p>
<p>The algorithm is me but if I truly thought about something longer than a day or if I see something that I hadn't ever believed useful/possible then I'll put it here:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/journal/blob/main/lists/knowledge.list">journal/lists/knowledge.list</a></p>
<p>As an example, <a href="https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/journal/commit/bcea5ce5b7552d5945e2b96eff11a9584d3f441d">yesterday</a> I stumbled upon the concept of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shot_tower">"Shot Tower"</a> so I added that Wikipedia article to my knowledge bank. I had no idea that something like this existed or that it actually works even though I'm familiar with the concept of gravity and the behavior of clouds and rain, etc.</p>
<h3>Quotes/Shower Thoughts</h3>
<p>Similarly, I record things that sound good here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/journal/blob/main/fun/quotes.long.md">fun/quotes.long.md</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/journal/blob/main/fun/quotes.short.md">fun/quotes.short.md</a></li>
</ul>
