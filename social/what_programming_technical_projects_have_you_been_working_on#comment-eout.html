<p>I've been downloading a lot of public domain imagery over the past ten years. I forgot why I started originally--but that's only about 20% of my collection. Another 10% or so are Creative Commons, or unknown status collections that I've downloaded over the years from curated collections (usually small websites but also flickr, DeviantArt, and similar platforms). The rest is mostly downloaded from various subreddits (just for example: wtfstockphotos, thomastheplankengine, printmaking, papertowns, thegrittypast). Some SFW, some not. I take around 15,000 photos per year--so not a whole lot compared to my broadcatching activities.</p>

<p>where did you acquire the R730xd</p>

<p>eBay. <a href="https://labgopher.com/">LabGopher</a> definitely helped a bit, though I don't remember if I found the specific listing from there. Looking at the iDRAC history it looks like this one used to be a Hadoop cluster for Sears Holdings--kinda neat... It's nice to have 384 GB of ECC RAM but also it is pretty loud! So definitely know what you are signing up for beforehand. It's nice to have a closet or basement to hide the noise away. I got it because it was a really good deal and I wanted to play around with BMC/DRAC...</p>
