<p>Thanks for your comment. It is really insightful. I've also lived through some tragic experiences as a child which could be considered abuse. When I read "on another occasion made Ally go outside alone after dark to “clean the garden” in the middle of winter" it made me think of many childhood memories. Of course, I have happy memories growing up too but I also remember doing confusing and meaningless labor. I don't say this to say <em>this made me who I am today</em> because I think that is incorrect thinking: abuse is always unjustified.</p>
<p>I say this because I think there are few perfect parents. In my case it was one parent who came up with "brilliant" discipline opportunities which were probably copied out of 1970s parenting book but which were actually abuse. I think that parent came up with new rules so that more punishment could be administered at a steady rate. But I could easily see two parents doing this. Especially because they both have high-stress jobs and I imagine they don't treat each other well. But, from a purely probability perspective, it's more likely that just one parent was the main abuser. I'm speculating that Allan has no backbone: a doormat but not abusive. In the very least he enabled the abuse to continue for years(!) As far as we can see, he didn't try to get help.</p>
<p>But I also wonder... how. common. this. is. In my own lived experience, the experiences in this article don't seem <em>that</em> extreme. The extreme part to me is all the stuff at the edges: the dropbox, the suicide, and the media. We wouldn't know about this story without these extreme things. It would just be something unknown.</p>
<p>I don't think my life would have been better if my parents divorced--but maybe it would have been better if one of my parents was less spineless. I don't think Allan or Catherine are far abnormal American parents. I think their story is more common than not but the litigation and their careers made them more incompatible and explosive with each other.</p>
<p>I don't think all parents are psychotic. I imagine that somehow most parents are able to work semi-cohesively in a positive way. I imagine that it is something that does not come naturally but it is something that people have to learn and work on.</p>
