For this specific situation I recommend trying `yt-dlp -F URL` and then choosing the format that you think is best and if it's the wrong one then try another one

But yes, the command that you posted in the OP _should_ give you closest to original quality

You can use `yt-dlp --skip-download --print format -f (various options) URL` to see what format yt-dlp will pick
