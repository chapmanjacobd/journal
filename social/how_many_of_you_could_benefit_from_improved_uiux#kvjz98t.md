Disclaimer: I don't really have an interest in writing GUI code myself but I welcome any CLI UX, user/market research, or even GUI UX discussion as Issues. I can't promise that I'll have enough time to respond to everything.

I will evaluate and respond to any opt-in GUI (Tkinter or optional dependency) Pull Requests
