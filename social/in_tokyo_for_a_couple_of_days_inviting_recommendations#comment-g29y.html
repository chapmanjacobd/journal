<p>I like the north part of the city: Asakusa, Machiya, Higashiogu, Oji... Just walk around and see interesting old buildings. Maybe watch <em>Adrift in Tokyo</em> (2007) before you go!</p>
<p>In Kyoto, Gion-Shijo is a really lovely area. Be sure to try a Kaiseki (it's like <a href="https://japanese-products.blog/2023/01/19/bento-vs-teishoku-vs-gozen-vs-kaiseki/">prix fixe</a>). <em>Tagoto honten</em> (御旅町田ごと) is not bad if you're on a budget but there are many better restaurants too.</p>
