<p>I would recommend just keeping it simple and doing as much as you can outside the computer. Then when you have something somewhat concrete lay it out and play around with it in the Playlist area.</p>
<p>Personally, I'm not a fan of the Channel Rack. It's powerful... but also really bad UI design (imho). Thankfully, you don't have to use it <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/FL_Studio/comments/qunxy3/debate_the_channel_rack_is_oldschool/">most of the time</a> if you don't want to.</p>

<p>Once you have something that sounds pretty good look into adding effects, sidechaining, and other weird things to see if you can squeeze a few percentage points more polish but it's easy to over do it--it's often better to do less.</p>
