<p>A lot of times the limitations have to do with the <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/1519893/why-does-a-gigabit-sec-internet-connection-via-cable-coax-not-offer-symmetrica">existing infrastructure</a>. If you browse the <a href="https://broadbandmap.fcc.gov/home">FCC Broadband map</a> you'll see that some neighborhoods have access to 15 Mb up while others have 40 Mb even within the same city and both neighborhoods are using copper wire. Not all neighborhoods have the same age of equipment, topology, or the same quality of wire. So the low upload speed that is common in the US is not as much an artifact of business greed as it is about technical debt</p>
