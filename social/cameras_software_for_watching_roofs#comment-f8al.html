<p>I've been pretty impressed with Reolink. Even their cheapest offerings at less than $50 have no monthly fee and can stream from WiFi to a remote server (FTP dropbox, or others), motion detection, notifications/alerts to email or phone number, etc.</p>
<p>Wyze Labs has some that don't even require a power outlet but having wired power and Ethernet improves reliability a lot. Put a UPS on the modem and camera power so it can still upload even during a blackout</p>
