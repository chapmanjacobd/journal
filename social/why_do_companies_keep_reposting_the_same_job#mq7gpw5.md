well... if you're still looking I'm here.

I'm sure it's also difficult on the hiring end of things right now but I also don't believe that all the thousands of people applying to some of these job posts are all incompetent.

It's likely that most of the competent programmers who aren't over-employed are being screened out very early in the process because they aren't as good at _persuasive_ communication or _sounding confident_ as the people that can lie well
