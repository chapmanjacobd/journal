<p>The first half of the video is kinda meh but the second half is where the good stuff is. The regrouping idea is very intuitive and it's unfortunate how the worksheet only has 10 as the big number over and over because it doesn't really teach the principle.</p>
<p>The idea is to break big numbers into friendly chunks like 59 becomes 40 + 10 + 5 + 4.</p>
<p>It helps to pick a number like 4, 5, or 6, to always use so that you only need to memorize a few fixed subtractions from 10.</p>
<p>Then when you see something like 44-27 you break it into groups which have as many similar numbers on each side as is comfortable and then you can just cross out the same numbers and subtract whichever is easiest:</p>
<p>(30 + 7 + 3 + 4) - (20 + 7)</p>
<p>cross out duplicates: 7</p>
<p>(30 + 3 + 4) - (20)</p>
<p>subtract the closest numbers: 30 - 20</p>
<p>10 + 3 + 4</p>
<p>add together the remaining chunks to get 17</p>
