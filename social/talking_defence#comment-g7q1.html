<p>Context: USA, recently have been playing a lot of <em>Itadaki Street</em> so I feel like I have a pretty good idea of what war is like</p>
<p>People need to feel safe. The primary purpose of the militaries of the world is to fight other humans--and in many cases people fight for or against ideas. It can be a rather sophisticated and expensive process. That is pretty astonishing isn't it? If we didn't have mad charismatic men and large-scale organized crime would we even need the nation-state? Maybe not but we don't live in that world.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as long as more than one group of people exists there will always be a need for mediation. Physical force is not always the best tool to use and it is nice when armed forces recognize that and choose alternative methods. If humanity acted like one people it would still be useful to have something similar to the military--but maybe instead of allocating resources on munitions we would allocate more on military engineering, large-scale aid, and filling local community needs.</p>
<p>I think we could do more <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/14/asia/india-china-border-tensions-video-intl-hnk">sticks &amp; stones</a>. Well <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/3090467/why-are-indian-and-chinese-soldiers-fighting-fists-sticks-and">maybe it's not going all that great</a> but it is still funny to watch, right? I think we humans largely do a <em>pretty good job</em> at not fighting--especially when it <em>really</em> doesn't need to happen.</p>
<p>But some fighting is unavoidable. You want to let out pressure from the seismic plates--a few hundred dead is better than millions by starvation and radiation sickness. But who decides who dies? That is a big reason why militaries fight so that the people in charge can maintain control over deciding who lives and dies.</p>
<p>The military-industrial complex type of thing could happen to any industry but especially those where people can't really say no and they continue to over-invest just to be safe... It is pretty telling that the USA is spending 16x on military compared to Ukraine: a country that has active warzone.</p>
<p>This problem of military-industrial complex must not be very different to the <em>medical</em>-industrial complex. The one that is making the USA a curious place to grow old... I wonder what industries are next? Perhaps local police and public safety--it is already a large line-item in most US cities but they could shut down a few more schools--we could always build a few more prisons...</p>
