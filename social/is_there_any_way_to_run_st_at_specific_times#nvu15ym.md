You could setup via Termux and then set up crond run syncthing and then run pkill syncthing at specific times--nothing wrong with that.

But you may, perhaps, be better served by just enabling it only on specific WiFi, only charge when connected to power, and force a max syncing time eg. it will run for 5 mins and then wait 5 mins--all of these are options in Syncthing Fork
