<p>Any time I, or any of her direct reports write a proposal, a policy, a report, or basically anything meant to distribute to a wide audience, they insist on us "running it through copilot"</p>

<p>At first glance this seems completely insane. But, if we ignore the very real possibility of corporate espionage Ã  la LLM, using an LLM to get help prepare something for a <strong>wider audience</strong> seems somewhat useful. That being said, her suggesting that you wholesale replace your writing with the LLM output seems incredulous.</p>

<p>I'm 99% sure that most of this is influencer clickbait capitalizing on FOMO to keep the shared delusion of LLM's usefulness going</p>

<p>Yes, that is a big part of it. But also:</p>
<p>Managing peer pressure, choosing to thinking independently, and actively pulling at threads is a learned skill. A lot of people don't know how to even get started. Humans are great at imitating and rote learning--but there is <em>something</em> that separates the person who invented kiteboarding and the Olympic kiteboarders. It's hard to pinpoint--and it doesn't matter much in every day life (or at least it didn't matter as much until now when everyone has a near infinite misinformation machine in their pocket: weaponized social media or LLMs).</p>
<p>It's not impossible that people accidentally invent something, but people who have learned to pull at threads are more successful at doing so. It's not that everyone who hasn't developed this skill of skepticism and forward action is a blind cultist who is only able to copy what is taught--but they are less likely to doubt the status quo and push against indoctrination. Especially when the system encourages offloading any critical thinking to the great word regurgitator in the cloud.</p>
<hr/>
<p>There are cases where LLMs are useful like you've mentioned. Translation of abstract concepts, summarization, searching for things that are difficult to describe (although I think it's largely an artifact of the TOMT class of subreddits--with the success of LLMs this source of contextual vectors will naturally erode), getting over the procrastination, bridging the left-brain/right-brain divide (ie. creating vs editing thinking; some people are great at starting with a blank page but most people are not)... But I feel like we need more writing criticizing LLMs so that they go away faster. They are a great tool but they are already severely misused by the general public.</p>
