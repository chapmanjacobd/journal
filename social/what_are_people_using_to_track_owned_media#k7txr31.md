> databases to browse for media you DON'T have

I keep line-delimited lists for media I don't have and then every day open up around 10 tabs from that file as part of a script: 

essentially `head -n 10 $file && sed -i -e 1,10d $file`

Every day I research those 10 media and decide if I want to consume them or ignore them. During this process I might add new similar media that I discover while researching the 10 "media of the day" to the "to research" file.
