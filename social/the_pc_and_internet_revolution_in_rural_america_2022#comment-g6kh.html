<p>The past few days I've been reading a lot about <a href="https://www.complete.org/nncp/">NNCP</a> and similar distributed/decentralized/delay-tolerant technologies and, while I haven't felt the need to go all in, it has been mentally stimulating. It's fascinating to read about <a href="https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/1031208/2335d9c8b8eb28c5/">some technology</a>, feel excited and wonder why everything isn't more like this, and then realize the larger problems which the technology doesn't really address. It's a recurring theme of humanity that we have to choose inferior tools just because they break in slightly different ways.</p>
<p>I don't personally have a use for NNCP but it is still a very interesting toolkit to study. There are a lot of great ideas here.</p>
<p>Anyway. I found this article while reading through John Goerzen's site and wanted to share it. Here are a few more:</p>
