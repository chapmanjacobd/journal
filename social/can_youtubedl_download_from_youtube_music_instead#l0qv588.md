It's all using the same infrastructure underneath but it depends what format your browser (javascript written by Google) chooses to load. 

For the same video ID, yt-dlp will load the same stream, whether from a youtube URL or youtube music URL. It's the same data.

yt-dlp works on a lot of sites. Generally I try it to see if it works instead of looking it up. Sometimes it isn't explicitly supported but I get lucky with the generic extractor
