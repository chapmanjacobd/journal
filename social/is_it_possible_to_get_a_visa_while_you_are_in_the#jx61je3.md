It depends on the country. Some countries make this easy. Some countries make this difficult or impossible. You will need to exit the country if it is a visa and not a visa extension.

It's usually cheaper and easier to do a "visa run": go to a different nearby country for at least one day (though you should consider to stay away longer). Also, it's important that you don't stay in the same country for more than ~180 days in a ~360 day time period unless you want to start paying taxes in that country.
