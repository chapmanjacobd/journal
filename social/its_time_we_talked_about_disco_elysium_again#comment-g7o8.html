<p>That's a great video! But it looks like this one has a some additional recent news. If one doesn't have the context and does have the time, it might make sense to watch Jeffiot's and then skip to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZEAs6M1wts&amp;t=1199s">this middle 20 minute section</a> and then <a href="https://youtu.be/lZEAs6M1wts?t=4727">the last 40 mins</a> of the one linked in this post.</p>
