<p>it skips 36 and goes to 34</p>

<p>I don't know if they mention this in the video but this immediately makes me think about something I read before in automatic cars: the stator clutch.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the vehicle accelerates, the turbine gradually gains speed in relation to the impeller. Eventually, the turbine speeds up to the point where the fluid begins to flow in one direction (clockwise).</p>
<p>As centrifugal force reduces vortex flow, torque multiplication is also reduced. Finally, when the turbine’s speed reaches about 90 percent of the impeller’s speed, the torque converter reaches “coupling” phase. In this phase, the torque converter simply transmits engine torque through the fluid coupling to the transmission input shaft.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not 100% sure if it's <em>specifically</em> the torque converter where 36 mph would be inefficient to stay at but I imagine there could very well be a component of a car where they decided to just skip 36 mph to increase the efficiency or longevity of the mechanical parts of the car (perhaps even a resonant frequency?? lol) rather than a specific electronic programming mistake.</p>
