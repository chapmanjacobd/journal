<p>I played <strong>Lacrimosa</strong> with some friends. It's a great little euro game. Takes a while to set up and get in the groove but I imagine it has very good replay-ability. It took us about 4.5 hours to play through a full game which is a simulation of the five stages of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's life and the completion of his unfinished Opus Requiem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Lacrimosa, players take the roles of patrons of the late musician, contributing with their fundings to the composer's works one last time. During the game, you play in two different timelines: the present and the past. In the present, you commission the missing parts of the Requiem from other composers in order to complete it. When developing past events, the game takes place in five epochs in which you contribute by buying new compositions from the composer to sell or exhibit, accompany him on the different journeys through the main courts and theaters in Europe, and gather the resources you need in order to support the musician during his career.</p>
