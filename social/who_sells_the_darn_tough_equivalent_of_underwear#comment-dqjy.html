<p>Uniqlo airism is indestructible but I find it somewhat uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Smartwool underwear is comfortable but only lasts a couple years before falling apart. Woolly Clothing Co is almost the same and has lasted a bit longer (no holes yet). I've heard good things about Point6 on the BIFL subreddit but I haven't tried it yet</p>
<p>edited: minus33 -&gt; Point6 because I misremembered</p>
