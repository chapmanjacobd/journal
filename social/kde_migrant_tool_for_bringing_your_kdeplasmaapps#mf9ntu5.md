It forces you to think carefully about where you store passwords but once you do that it's not so difficult. I would say the benefits outweigh the negatives. You don't have to use a public git server, additionally you could also configure git in a centralized way ([client](https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/computer/blob/main/.config/fish/functions/git_remote_use_server.fish), [server](https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/computer/blob/main/.config/fish/functions/git_remote_serve.fish)) [ie. laptop=client, desktop=server, you'll probably want something like Tailscale to handle the networking], or use syncthing.

Actually, you can use Syncthing and Git at the same time. I use syncthing because some things aren't stored in Git but I still want things to be in sync. I only sync my `.config` and `.local` folders. Just be sure to put `/syncthing/` in your [.config/.stignore](https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/computer/blob/main/.config/.stignored) to keep the two computers from replacing each other's syncthing identities... Likewise for [.local/.stignore](https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/computer/blob/main/.local/.stignored) there are quite a few directories you probably want to ignore like the trash bin.

You don't have to symlink `.stignored` to `.stignore` but it allows syncthing to synchronize those files as well.....
