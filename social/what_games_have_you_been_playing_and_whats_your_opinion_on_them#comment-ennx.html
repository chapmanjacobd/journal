<p>The wife and I have been enjoying the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakuza_(franchise)#Setting">Yakuza</a> series. We're currently playing <em>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</em> (2024) which has a lot of gameplay in Honolulu, Hawaii. The story is a bit convoluted at times but it has been enjoyable overall!</p>
<p>If you haven't tried the series, I recommend checking out <em>Yakuza: Like a Dragon</em> (2020) and <em>Lost Judgment</em> (2021). Lost Judgement feels like it stands on its own pretty well but it is definitely more serious and slowly paced.</p>
