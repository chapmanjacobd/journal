<p>I've been playing <strong>The Outer Worlds 2</strong> and it is almost as fun as the first game. If you aren't familiar with the series it feels and plays very similar to both the Borderlands series and the Fallout 3+ series. That is, there's a bit more of a continuous storyline with more meat and dialogue than Borderlands, while not quite being as well-written as the Fallout series, but the game engine doesn't feel as buggy as the modern Fallout games.</p>
<p>The choices that you can make in the game don't have much breadth but the game still posits situations with political and philosophical concerns that one can chew on often enough. I've played through 15 hours and there's still a few more places that I haven't explored on the first world but the game is starting to feel a little bit repetitive <em>but I haven't lost interest completely yet</em>.</p>
