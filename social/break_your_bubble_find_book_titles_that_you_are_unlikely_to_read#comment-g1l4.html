<p>My point isn't that there are no different books, it's that there are a surprising number of similar ones and basically no "sell" to help me pick from the different ones</p>

<p>For sure--I can see where you are coming from and I agree.</p>
<p>I imagine having even a Goodreads score as social proof would be more convincing. I also think showing book covers is antithetical to the goal of helping people choose to read something that they wouldn't pick in the first place <em>because</em> of the book cover, title, author's name, etc.</p>
<p>Maybe this doesn't fall under fair use but if I was building a site like this it might be interesting to just throw the raw text at people--maybe not the whole first chapter but the first few five or ten pages...</p>
