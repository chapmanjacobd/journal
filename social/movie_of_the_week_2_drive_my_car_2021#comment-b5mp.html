<p>I'm surprised how well this film contrasts with last week's film, <em>Day for Night</em> (1973). Both films have a text within the text (the story within the story) which is acted out by actors and directed by directors.</p>
<p>And both films are trying to get us to think about how we consume and reproduce media. How we select media and how our choices affect us. <em>Drive My Car</em> (2021) is certainly a bit better at this and it is asking more questions.</p>
<p>Some non-questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>suction-cup-like mouths ... "and she becomes a lamprey again"</li>
<li>Reading the text in a voice without emotion</li>
<li>Takatsuki: "What happened today, between Janice and Yoo-na?"</li>
<li>Kafuku: "Only they know the answer to that. One thing I can say is that this text has the power to make that happen"</li>
<li>Takatsuki: "Why aren't you playing Vanya yourself?"</li>
<li>Kafuku: "Chekhov is terrifying. When you say his lines it drags out the real you. Don't you feel it? ... Yield yourself and respond to the text ... The text is questioning you."</li>
<li>The concept of stories ending (death of an idea) or continuing (reproduction of ideology)</li>
<li>Saab cars just look great in the snow... like seeing a swan in its natural habitat #saablovers jk Saab ㅋㅋㅋ</li>
<li>multiple personality disorder as a narrative device (Watari's mom / Sachi)</li>
<li>"Those who survive keep thinking about the dead in one way or another"</li>
<li>Kafuku (as Vanya): "Sonya. I'm miserable. If you only know how miserable I am."</li>
<li>Yu-rim as Yoo-na (as Sonya): "What can we do? We must live our lives. Yes, we shall live, Uncle Vanya. We'll live through the long, long days, and through the long nights. We'll patiently endure the trials that fate sends our way ... and when our last hour comes we'll go quietly..."</li>
</ul>
<p>In a way, <em>Day for Night</em> (1973) became the movie that it was filming: the movie inside the movie. <em>Drive My Car</em> (2021) likewise became Samuel Beckett's <em>Waiting for Godot</em> (1953). The meta-movie and the movie are both text. And text is flat. It can be interwoven, but it still maintains flatness. It's up to the reader or the watcher to interpret and weigh meta-text against text.</p>
<p>It's interesting that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q77jgal4Gto">Waiting for Godot</a> is an absurdist play, or at least seen as one. Last week I said that <em>Day for Night</em> is a film about the absurdity of filmmaking; and I still think that is true. Certainly, <em>Drive My Car</em> has moments of absurdity: walking in on a cheating wife, driving one hour away to a hotel every day, half-believing that you killed a loved one through inaction; but all of these things can be rationalized, if not part of every day life.</p>
<p>Maybe some people ignore the movie within the movie but the movie within the movie still provides a vehicle for the "actors" to process their emotions. It provides a flavour for the enclosing story. And perhaps too the movie as a whole colours our own lives. A life is its own enclosing story and we are all actors inside this hell-home we call <em>Synecdoche, New York</em> (2008).</p>
<p>But this all begs the question, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arxTe28OsK0">who is driving the car</a>? Am I driving my car? Is Samuel Beckett driving my car? Is Haruki Murakami driving my car? Is Ryusuke Hamaguchi driving my car? Is Misaki Watari driving my car? Is Toko Miura driving my car? Kafuku is not driving my car because he has Glaucoma but maybe Nishijima does not have Glaucoma, and maybe Glaucoma is just a plot device. Oops... line please!</p>
