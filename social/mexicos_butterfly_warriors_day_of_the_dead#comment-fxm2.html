<p>After the Spanish conquest, the idea of a link between the souls of the dead and butterflies in Indigenous cultures of central Mexico faded. But in the past decade, monarch butterfly imagery has resurfaced in celebrations of the Day of the Dead. Participants in Day of the Dead parades have begun to dress as monarchs, and decorations bearing butterfly motifs have taken their place alongside more traditional imagery celebrating the holiday. Nielsen notes that the publication of a popular childrenâ€™s book, <em>I Remember Abuelito</em>, in 2007, in which a girl imagines her dead grandfather as a migrating monarch butterfly, may be partly responsible for the resurgence in monarch imagery.</p>

<p>It may also be worth noting that <em>Venture Bros.</em> piloted in 2003 (and a year later S01E01: <em>Dia de los Dangerous</em>)... It's difficult to say how popular <em>Venture Bros</em> is in Mexico but one cannot overstate the impact of seeing a charming and accomplished butterfly-suit wearing supervillain, The Monarch, on syndicated television.</p>
