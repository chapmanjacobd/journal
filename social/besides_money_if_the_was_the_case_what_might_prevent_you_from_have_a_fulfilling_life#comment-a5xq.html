<p>I know there are things that I can do to make my own life more healthy and prevent health problems down the road:</p>
<ul>
<li>walk outside more</li>
<li>more quality sleep</li>
<li>buy a newer house and make sure every material it is build with does not cause harm (no lead pipes on the water supply line, no mold possibilities, no hollow walls for mice) and that the environment is beneficial (more feng shui, more nature, more calm)</li>
<li>go to the gym every day (or at least go for a run)</li>
<li>cook meals more &amp; cook healthy meals: no frozen entrees, no microplastics</li>
<li>better time management. time box everything, work harder</li>
<li>relax harder, play harder. I'm being a bit facetious but this is a true desire. I want to be more engaged with entertainment. Fully immersed. Jacked-in the matrix. Extreme TV watching. Where is my <a href="https://youtu.be/fpnd1OboPPs">Lenval Brown</a> monologue AI to narrate my life 24-hours-a-day?</li>
</ul>
<p>but beyond a certain threshold it is difficult to care. If I had more money then I would try to outsource the solution more aggressively but different plans to prevent future problems have different risk profiles. Some plans to be more healthy are less probable to make an impact. This correlates (but imperfectly) with the cost of each plan: some ideas hemorrhage money more than others.</p>
<p>Money can solve most problems but only if one is willing to solve their problem and one knows how to solve it.</p>
<p>Another related problem is that once you have some money you see a different world of possibilities than you saw before. Your new worldview might even require less capital than you had before but your perspective has changed (even if your Identity has only changed superficially). But it's also possible that your new goals require even more capital than you correctly have. Both of these worldview changes are "first-world problems" but they are very costly.</p>
<p>Depending on your personality type this dissatisfaction with the present is either entertainment or annoyance but both possibilities distract from living in the moment and feeling fulfilled.</p>
<p>Completed goals are a "fulfilling" but if uncompleted goals are over-emphasized they are antithetical to <em>feeling</em> fulfilled. And if uncompleted goals are under-emphasized then there is no motivation for becoming "fulfilled". So I see this as a balancing problem between multiple-sized animal-skin liquid containers and everyone has different-sized animal-skin liquid containers and the liquids are motivation and feelings.</p>
