<p>Namecheap, Porkbun</p>

<p>Since you've named the two big ones that were compelling to me... I've also used Namecheap for a long time and was thinking about Porkbun but did a little more research and decided to switch to Cloudflare Registrar. There's nothing fundamentally <em>wrong</em> with Porkbun but I don't hear Cloudflare named often as an alternative, and it has a great UI for managing DNS (as well as good integration with free Cloudflare DDoS prevention, etc), so I wanted to mention it</p>
