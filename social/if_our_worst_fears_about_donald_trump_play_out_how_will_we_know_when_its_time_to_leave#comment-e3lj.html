<p>a very dark opportunity to create labor camps</p>

<p>well... since slavery was abolished, and even to this day, almost all state and federal adult prisons in the United States have some form of work program, "employing" around 800,000 people. But a lot of those jobs, even though the pay is <em>criminal</em>, is usually related to prison maintenance (cleaning, food services, etc).</p>
<p>But you are right that most of those jobs aren't industry jobs (goods and services for the world outside the prison) and Trump's private interests make it seem like this would be the kind of thing he might do under the guise of making the market more free...</p>
<p>Scary thought! But it takes a while to construct more prisons... and I would say the current 1.8 million people incarcerated is already both a problem and stretching the limits of what is feasible for society.</p>
<p>There are likely many federal and state laws which would make this difficult for Trump to actually do, for instance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>private-sector companies are legally obligated to pay prisoners “prevailing wages” in order to avoid undercutting non-prison labor<br/>
