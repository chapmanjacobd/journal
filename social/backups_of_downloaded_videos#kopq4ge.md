The Internet Archive is a good place.

I think the likelihood of Google deleting a video from your Google Drive account is a little more likely than you losing access to a video from drive failure. 

Of course it depends what is the _actual content_ of the video but if it is video that has been registered with Content ID by being uploaded to YouTube I'm pretty sure Google Drive integrates with that system and even if you actually own the copyright of the video [they might assume that you are infringing on the copyrights](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31680894)
