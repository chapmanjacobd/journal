If you have that as guaranteed income then I would read all the fine print to ensure you don't lose that for any arbitrary reason (eg. moving, Country-Specific Limitations). That would be my number one priority.

Second, I would still leave some money in HYSA and SGOV but the majority of it I would put in medium-high risk investments. Do you imagine you'll need the money in 5 years? 10 years? Doubtful. Just let it sit and grow.
