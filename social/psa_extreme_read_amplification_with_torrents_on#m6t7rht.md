I don't know how much this helps but I always use "POSIX-compliant" IO type in qbittorrent instead of the memory-mapped default (because it doesn't work with mergerfs--my underlying fs is a mix of btrfs and ext4. I haven't noticed a difference in performance or usage statistics when seeding from mergerfs or directly referencing the mounts so I don't think mergerfs is affecting this) and I don't seem to have this read amplification problem. Might be worth trying!
