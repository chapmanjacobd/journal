It's not so much _more_ vacations but _longer_ vacations.

Americans will fly across the world and only spend a few days there and then fly back. It makes travel really expensive compared to staying longer if you divide money/days. It's like spending $3,000 for a week instead of spending $3,300 for twice the amount of time
