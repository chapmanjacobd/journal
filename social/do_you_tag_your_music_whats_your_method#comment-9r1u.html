<p>I used to use stuff like Musicbrainz Picard (and sometimes still do if I want to know where a song came from and Shazam or Google Assistant can't figure it out), and I would recommend Picard for automated tagging, but in the last few years I've shifted into a weird mode: there is really a lot of music out there and I realized that tags, album covers, or audio quality (beyond a certain threshold)--doesn't really matter.</p>
<p>If you have a lot of music then listen to the music and enjoy the music for what it is. Music is not audio tags. Music is not album art. Music is not an expensive DAC or a listening room. Although all those things can contribute to the accessibility or enjoyment of music listening--if you never heard a song before then you've never experienced it at all.</p>
<p>So my advice is... try not to worry about it? Only fix audio tags if that brings you pleasure. There is value in doing a multi-source metadata deep-dive for your favorite albums or artists and ensuring their tags are pristine and accurate.</p>
<p>Automated tagging can do more harm than good--if the computer can correctly guess the track today then why not just leave the metadata as-is? The computer will only get better at guessing (it is possible that MusicBrainz/AcoustID will one day disappear but when it does, I'm sure it will either be replaced with something even better OR it won't matter anymore because the world is ending).</p>
<p>If you haven't created an emotional connection with the music AND if organizing things is a burden then there is almost no reason to curate it</p>
