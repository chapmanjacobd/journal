<p>This seems pretty standard. Layout and graphic design is pretty click-intensive. Not sure if there's a way to get around that 100%...</p>
<p>However, if you find you're doing a lot of similar tasks there are two key things which might help:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Shortcuts. You don't have to use the built-in ones if they are difficult to remember--you can usually remap them to something else. But I imagine something like learning Indesign's Go To Page shortcut (Command+J on Mac or Ctrl+J on Windows), or other navigation concepts will help you bring down the number of clicks that you need to do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automation; eg. InDesign's Data Merge to template out different types of projects (the product catalogue sounds like a great candidate for this), Photoshop Actions, etc. There are usually ways to macro out repetitive tasks in Adobe programs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Non-destructive editing... I'm not too familiar with Affinity Publisher but maybe you could use filter / "Adjustment" layers to change colors... or once you have a design locked down and the colors are approved move that specific color/flavor to its own file.</p>
<p>Maybe you could make the Art stuff its own file:</p>
