<p>OpenSSH is also being more vocal about it with v10.1:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To encourage migration to these stronger algorithms, OpenSSH 10.1 will warn the user when a non post-quantum key agreement scheme is selected, with the following message:</p>
<p>** WARNING: connection is not using a post-quantum key exchange algorithm.<br/>
** This session may be vulnerable to "store now, decrypt later" attacks.<br/>
** The server may need to be upgraded. See <a href="https://openssh.com/pq.html">https://openssh.com/pq.html</a></p>
