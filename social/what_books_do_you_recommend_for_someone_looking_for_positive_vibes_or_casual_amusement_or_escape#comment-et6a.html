<p>I really recommend comic books for this! There's a lot out there--it's not just action comics. I recommend taking a look at Keiichi Arawi's series Nichijou. If you like it, check out CITY.</p>
<p>Other than that I quite like Young Adult fiction when turning my brain off. A lot easier to read when there aren't a bunch of big worlds! Take a look at <em>Molly Moon's Incredible Book of Hypnotism</em>.</p>
