<p>I made a little rust experiment of <code>library fsadd --fs</code> and published it as <a href="https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/library-rs">library-rs</a>. I still don't really know what I'm doing with in Rust so a lot of it is vibe-coded. I spent a lot of time playing around with compiling libmagic on Windows (via GitHub Actions--I don't have access to a Windows machine). After trying both msys2 and a vcpkg approach for a few hours, not too mention that multi-threading with libmagic is <a href="https://github.com/robo9k/rust-magic-sys/issues/28#issuecomment-1286059034">a bit fiddly</a>, I gave up and went with <code>tree-magic-mini</code> which <em>works</em> but it has some <a href="https://github.com/mbrubeck/tree_magic/issues/23#issuecomment-3264434684">shortcomings</a>.</p>
<p>I tried a bunch of different concurrency approaches via ChatGPT and Gemini but in the end the program is not quite as fast as the Python version which was somewhat surprising. For disks with a lot of really small files <code>library-rs</code> was significantly faster but most of the time it is a pretty close tie.</p>
