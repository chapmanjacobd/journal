I don't know if it is a "Black Friday" deal but there are two 18TiB manufacturer refurbished options from goharddrive:

- $159.99 with 5 year reseller warranty [ST18000NM003D](https://www.ebay.com/itm/155636746868)
- $179.99 with 5 year reseller warranty [ST18000NM000J](https://www.ebay.com/itm/176041448046)

I bought the ST18000NM003D last weekend, it arrived Wednesday and it has been great so far. Let's see how many months or years it will last~
