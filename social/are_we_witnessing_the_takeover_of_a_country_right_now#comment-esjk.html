<p>At first it was shocking and I could only assume the worst, but after reading about it more I'm not <em>too</em> worried. While it doesn't look good and it is absolutely improper... but what they are doing is legal (at least from a 1000 ft view--the executive branch decides how to execute and the congress decides how to congress) though some of the details may be illegal.</p>
<p>The biggest problem that I see with this situation is that, compared to before, there seems to be even less oversight and they've thrown all processes and procedures out the window. They are likely using DeepSeek or OpenAI to write COBOL/JCL. I don't think their goal is to break it or accidentally delete everything. But I don't think there will be zero side effects from what is happening...</p>

<li>Most likely they'll pretend to keep things as-is while "auditing" but payments will be delayed and infrequent for the programs that they don't like: Meals on Wheels, Special Olympics, Medicaid, etc. But Social Security and Medicare will largely be unaffected.</li>
<li>(Maybe) Musk will remove certain organizations from the blacklist like Russia, North Korea, and ensure his own companies remain off the paymetns blacklist so that he can continue to get paid even when he gives military starlink access to Putin (or something equally bad). This specific example likely won't happen because it is its own network  and DoD doesn't use the US Treasury to make payments. Maybe this is a bit out there but it is pretty telling when he boasts about "the enemy" (The US government) taking a break over the weekend.</li>
