I'm writing a little program for this but youtube-dlp does 99% of the heavy lifting with the archive flag

for downloading videos you can set yt-dlp to only dl videos with titles matching a glob

for videos that were already downloaded I use grep. 

If you aren't familiar with CLI tools I highly recommend trying out WSL. It's worth the time investment
