I'll add a --tag flag to `fsadd` if you open up a ticket for it. Maybe there could also be a subcommand for adding/editing tags. 

You can search all columns of the sqlite db with `lb sdb`

But if your tags are already part of the path, I don't really get why you'd want to go through the effort of moving everything. You can use `plocate` to build an index and find files and that works a bit faster than my program.

Also, it is a little complex but Git Annex might be a good fit for you
