<p>I finally found a good use for systemd-nspawn: editing raw bootable images. I put together a few scripts for Internet in a Box and Raspberry Pi OS: <a href="https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/iiab-image">https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/iiab-image</a> I'm working on getting Debian images also working since those raw images are slightly different (EFI partition instead of simple boot partition)</p>
<p>If you're interested in this, I recommend giving this video a watch: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89ESCBzM-3Q">Build your own Container Runtime with chroot</a></p>
<p>bootc is perhaps a better alternative to this... but that mostly only works with Fedora (<a href="https://mrguitar.net/?p=2605">Bootable containers on the Raspberry Pi 4</a>) but I'm having fun~</p>

<p>Some other neat things I worked on this week:</p>
<h3><a href="https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/computer/blob/main/bin/depth">depth.py</a></h3>
<p>I can copy a bunch of links then:</p>
<pre><code>$ cb | depth

Depth | Count | Sample Line
3     | 18    | https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Araspberry-pi+org%3Aoffspot&amp;type=Repositories
4     | 24    | https://github.com/offspot/base-image
5     | 92    | https://github.com/offspot/base-image/forks
</code></pre>
<p>Then choose a depth to filter the list</p>
<pre><code>$ cb | depth 4
https://github.com/offspot/base-image
https://github.com/offspot/offspot-config
https://github.com/offspot/imager-service
https://github.com/offspot/provisioner
https://github.com/offspot/provision-os
https://github.com/offspot/testbench
...
</code></pre>
<h3>Linux only: see which files are being written to and how much they increase over time</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/computer/blob/main/bin/fatrace_agg_size.py">fatrace_agg_size.py</a></p>
<pre><code>$ fatrace_agg_size.py --min-size=3M --min-delta=2M --sort=size
</code></pre>
