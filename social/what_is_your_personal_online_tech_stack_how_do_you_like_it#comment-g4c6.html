<p>I'm also fairly skeptical of the whole cloud thing. It's a great way to start getting unexpected and head-scratching invoices. There are definitely some benefits but cloud is largely designed to extract value from companies. Even if your costs are continue to be low they are able to see how to copy your business via the API calls that you use--the more cloud native, the easier it is for them to do so.</p>
<p>I mostly write/use CLI tools because they are easy to schedule and 100% automate once you have something that works. I'm currently sitting on around 325 TiB and looking to downscale just because I realized I'm spending less time doing things I like and more time tending the "Japanese rock garden" (balancing free space semi-manually) and using more electricity than I would like. Recently, I bought one of these: <a href="https://www.newegg.com/orico-psc-l20-bk/p/1B0-0003-000N6?Item=9SIA1DSFD24446">20-Bay hard drive storage box</a>. I'm excited to experience de-growth.</p>
<h3>File storage &amp; synchronization</h3>
<p>I've tried a few different things over the years like mdadm, mergerfs, etc. But more recently I've just been using individual drives without RAID or backups. If I cared less about electricity and storage costs I would probably move to Unraid.</p>
<p>To keep things cheap I use a lot of cheap disks. I recently bought six 4TB SAS drives for $36. That's $1.5/TB. I use small disks like these similar to how people use LTO tape.</p>
<p>I use syncthing and have many copies of data that is important to me. A couple offline copies too. I should probably use a fancy backup rotation scheme but I don't. My most important data rarely changes though so it is probably fine.</p>
<h3>Email</h3>
<p>I've self-hosted email before but it's really a pain to properly maintain. Nowadays I mostly use Proton and Gmail.</p>
<h3>Media streaming</h3>
<p>Despite having a few servers in my house I rarely stream from one to another unless you count rsync. I guess I do use sshfs every so often but mostly I, instead, catalogue everything with plocate and, my own program, <a href="https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/library">library</a>.</p>
<p>I move files <a href="https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/computer/blob/main/.config/fish/functions/check_local.fish">as</a> <a href="https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/computer/blob/main/bin/locate_remote_mv.py">needed</a> and <a href="https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/computer/blob/main/.config/fish/functions/mrmusic.fish">swap out</a> my music folder <a href="https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/computer/blob/main/.config/fish/functions/weekly.fish">every week</a>.</p>
<p>I use the same program, library, to queue up mpv. It helps me sort and filter media by duration, title, and other media metadata. I use library to play music and videos (sometimes at the same time! <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/AMVHell">AMV Hell</a> style). I use library on desktop, laptop, and phone. I have Tasker/Termux <a href="https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/phone/blob/main/setup.sh#L29">integration</a> set up so that when I push <code>next</code> on my car's steering wheel it <a href="https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/phone/blob/main/.config/fish/functions/nextSong.fish">deletes the song</a> permanently on my phone.</p>
<p>But it's also kind of a <a href="https://curtclifton.net/papers/MoseleyMarks06a.pdf">tar pit</a> (emergent complexity). mpv on its own is also <a href="https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/computer/tree/main/.config/mpv/">very capable</a>.</p>
<p>I prefer using the CLI instead of something like XBMC or Subsonic (you can tell how dated my experience is, no?) because I suffer from acute judge-a-book-by-its-cover-itis. I've found it more pleasurable to just be surprised by the content of media. I rarely look up movie reviews or look at album covers <em>before</em> watching something.</p>
