<p>For what it is worth I've taken as many personality related tests as the University would pay for and the <a href="https://openpsychometrics.org/">openpsychometrics</a> website has very similar results to the expensive tests and it is free. So I don't think it's impossible to find something very similar to SII that is free... but I agree that it is not easy and that there are a lot of scammy companies.</p>
<p>One site that I've used in the past is O*NET. It's not perfect but it might be good enough:</p>
