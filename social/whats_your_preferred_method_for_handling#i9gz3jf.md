Email is a job in of itself. I would recommend Google Workspaces for sending/receiving email. To send it you'll want to add your VM's IP addresses to the Google Workspace's SPF record or maybe there is a way to use Google Workspaces to send mail via SMTP or something so you don't need to setup SPF, DKIM, DMARC, worry about emails not being seen even though you aren't on a SPAM blacklist, etc etc
