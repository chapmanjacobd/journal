<p>I think "famous" in the author's title is referring more to pop culture fame and not necessarily foundational cognitive science findings.</p>

<p>A lot of the older perhaps more traditional pop-culture-famous experiments (Milgram, Zimbardo...) have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis#In_psychology">failed to replicate</a> as well. Humans are rather finicky... especially the scientists doing the psychology research it would seem... gotta get a paycheck <em>somehow</em></p>
<p>I've taken a few psychology classes but it's hard for me to recall really foundational cognitive psychology studies. Hopefully someone more enlightened than I can answer this--I guess it is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_psychology#Cognitive_processes">not too difficult to look at Wikipedia</a></p>
<p>Even something like personality psychology has <a href="https://projects.ori.org/lrg/pdfs_papers/what.the.hell.pdf">Big 5</a> which sounds more like a type of gum or chewing tobacco but at least it is tangible and provides a foundation of common vocabulary...</p>
