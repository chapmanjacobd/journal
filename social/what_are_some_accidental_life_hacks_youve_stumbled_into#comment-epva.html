<h4>Motion and light sensitive night lights</h4>
<p>I have them in every room in my house and they are very handy at night or even just for dark rooms. They work very instantly and reliably, when jumping out of bed and walking to the toilet in the middle of the night I don't need to turn on any light switch.</p>
<p>I got 4 of them for $10 (three years ago, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07KS2J6Q5">Emotionlite Motion Sensor Light</a>) and it's probably the best $10 that I ever spent.</p>
<h4>Cowboy boots</h4>
<p>I feel like I've always dreaded needing to go out in the snow. One of the big reasons was that it is time consuming to tie up shoes / boots.</p>
<p>Last year I got a pair of Eddie Bauer zipper boots to try and solve this problem but they turned out to be even worse. They were both difficult to zip up and easy to unzip so they would always unzip themselves after walking a bit outside.</p>
<p>But a couple weeks ago I thought about what the ideal boot would be like... something tall that I could still slip my feet in and out of and I discovered cowboy boots! LOL!</p>
<p>Sometimes you need to think "from first principles" and build up a generic idea for what the solution should look like.</p>
<p>Cowboy boots are actually pretty comfy and are a great winter boot! I would not have set out to buy them without inventing them first myself <em>per se</em> because I had preconceived notions of what a cowboy boot is and what it is good or not good for and what kind of people wear them, etc. But everyone can wear them--not just cowboys and rednecks.</p>
<h4>Breaking down large tasks to be incremental and then taking small bites every day</h4>
<p>This one is a neat concept but actually doing it takes diligence and successfully implementing a system into your daily schedule.</p>
<p>Figuring out the right integration point can turn a monotonous Sisyphus rock into something that is fun and creative. I'm not perfect at this but I feel like some of my proudest accomplishments were only possible because I found the strategy.</p>
<p>For example, my goal was to add my whole home folder into Git but there was really several hundreds a lot of configuration files and folders and it seemed like an impossible task.</p>
<p>However, I automated the process. I put the list of all the files in <code>.gitignore</code> and then once per day a script would run <code>sed -i '$ d' .gitignore</code> to remove the last line of the gitignore file so that I would need to investigate that configuration and determine which action I should take: add to the <a href="https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/computer/">home folder repo</a>, add back into <code>.gitignore</code> (at the top of the file), add to <code>.git/info/exclude</code>, <code>git update-index --skip-worktree</code>, etc.</p>
<p>The trick is to split up large tasks and integrate the tasks at manageable intervals.</p>
