<p>Lifetime Windows user ... I don't like the direction Microsoft has gone with Windows so I'd really like to adapt to using Linux otherwise</p>

<p>Just keep using Windows until you get to the point where it is impossible to deal with the barrage of M$ inconveniences. It's undoubtedly going to get worse <em>but it's going to gradually</em>.</p>
<p>Using Linux halfway is going to have twice the annoyances with little gain unless you prefer *nix shells. Just wait until you rip the band-aid clean off.</p>
<p>There's a lot of software that works great on Windows <em>and</em> Linux, like nushell. Find these and use them so that when you make the transition you don't have as much pain learning new applications at the same time as learning to deal with OS/distro quirks.</p>
