<li><em>The Art Institute of Chicago</em> is a recent favorite. Lots of artwork organized very well. We spent five hours there and didn't see everything.</li>
<li>The <em>Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium</em> is stunning! Okinawa has many outdoor museums as well. <em>Nakagusuku</em> and <em>Nakijin</em> are both must-see castles</li>
<li>Speaking of outdoor museums... There are a lot of outdoor excavations in <em>Gyeongju, South Korea</em> which make the whole city feel like a museum. The <em>Gyeongju National Museum</em> and surrounding buildings are also very worth stepping inside.</li>
<li>I really enjoyed <em>Seonyudo Information Center</em> in Seoul. I didn't go in a lot of other museums but this is a very nice area to walk around nature and learn about the history of the small island. The <em>Seoul City Wall Museum</em> is kinda meh--going for a <a href="https://seoulcitywall.seoul.go.kr/en/content/72.do">hike around all the walls</a> is a much neater experience! And if you hike and collect all 28 stamps then you can get a special <a href="https://english.seoul.go.kr/service/amusement/seoul-trail/02-seoul-trail-tour/">Seoul Trail Completion Certificate</a></li>
<li>The <em>Hong Kong Museum of History</em> and the <em>Hong Kong Maritime Museum</em> are both adequate but not overly memorable.</li>
<li>The <em>Peranakan Museum</em> in Singapore is a must-see! Lots of interesting history about the culture. The other asian civilisations museums are also decent. If you care about buildings and city planning the <em>Singapore City Gallery</em> was also a nice surprise.</li>
<li>Taiwan has <em>a lot</em> of museums and small, quirky art galleries so it is hard to pick but I will say the <em>Chimei Museum</em> is very beautiful.</li>
<li>Going up the <em>St. Louis arch</em> is a very memorable experience</li>
<li>My friends just got back from the <em>Arabia Steamboat Museum</em> and they can't stop talking about it. I've never been but from the photos online it doesn't look that special. However, the story about the museum itself and how they found and dug up the buried ship is very fascinating to read!</li>
<li>The <em>Concord Museum</em> is not that interesting but there is a <em>very</em> good timelapse map on the second-floor of the museum</li>
<li>The <em>Natural History Museum of Utah</em> is very big and I never saw more dinosaurs in one place in my entire life</li>
