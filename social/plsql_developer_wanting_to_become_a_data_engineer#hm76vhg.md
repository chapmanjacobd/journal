You already know enough to be hired.

You can learn these things but not knowing them shouldn't prevent you from getting a DE job given your existing expertise:

- dbt
- awk, sed, xsv, jq
- Git Workflow / CICD
- digdag or dagster
- incremental data loading strategies
- columnar databases, data cubes, knowing when to choose OLAP vs OLTP

Try to get some experience with cloud technologies. Cloud functions are usually overrated and misused but you should know when they are a good fit.
