I would be very surprised if they didn't convert from the original source file for each output file.

Try downloading two different formats and comparing the quality using something like [spek](https://github.com/alexkay/spek): https://interviewfor.red/en/spectrals.html

I recommend doing a [blind listening test](https://hydrogenaud.io/index.php/topic,120166.0.html) where you don't know which is which and can choose which one sounds better.
