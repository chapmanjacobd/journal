<p>This site is pretty big. Lots of interesting web art and digital experiences. It looks like the author also explained some of their methods and reasons for making this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Technology has always been the gateway to the unknown frontier; digital space is not a tool or a medium, it is the invisible unreality that is waiting to be found.</p>
<p>In the misty days some time around the millennium I had the notion I would like to make my own website. However, being six years old and not knowing much about anything that idea would take sixteen years and a degree in Computer Science to be realised.</p>
<p>My work is heavily inspired by the myth of early technology, ‘80s CGI and the ‘90s web, a messy, inexplicable place, full of unknown possibilities and innocent ideals. The folk revival of the web is still out of sight but very much in reach. I see it as an antidote to the miasma the internet has become today, or at least a promise that tomorrow can be better.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>You’ll never live in a utopia, but you can glance into one. Economies are based on scarcity; the number of things you own or provide, and the things you can gain from others.</p>
<p>However digital space has no scarcity, it’s impossible to make a digital asset scarce. On the web everything is unlimited; on the web we all own infinite worlds, we are all kings and queens. It's an economy of creativity, the only limits are time and imagination.</p>

<p>The Web Revival is about reclaiming the technology in our lives and asking what we really want from the tools we use, and the digital experiences we share. The Web Revival often references the early Internet, but it's not about recreating a bygone web; the Web Revival is about reviving the spirit of openness and fresh excitement that surrounded the Web in its earliest days.</p>
