I don't think there's much similarity between Rio and wezterm. Rio is super buggy in my experience.

wezterm is pretty good if you are forced to use Windows. It even seems slightly more configurable than kitty. [vtm](https://github.com/directvt/vtm) is also a neat project. I would probably use that on Windows if wezterm didn't exist

but on Linux I always use kitty
