<p>Filling out a CBP 3299 almost feels like a programming project. At first glance it seems like a simple two-page form but given close examination there are so many weird eye-brow raising inconsistencies. It is simultaneously perfectly reasonable and completely insane. A bit like javascript. It was probably designed via committee with each person focused on the thing they cared about the most... each part is reasonable in isolation but together: confusing. disjointed. not whole.</p>
