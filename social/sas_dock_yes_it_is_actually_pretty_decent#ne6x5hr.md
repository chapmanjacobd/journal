I recently thought that I needed to buy one of these but after a bit more research I realized that the only thing stopping me from using my LSI 9207-8i for SAS is the small physical obstruction between data and power.

The problem is that Mini SAS to SATA cables seem to be more popular than the more versatile Mini SAS (+Molex or SATA Power) to SAS cables. If you already have a SAS card but are thinking of getting a SAS dock you may only need something like this instead:

- $17 [Molex](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HL4M1P2)
- $14 [SATA Power](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B010CMW6S4)

Just double check that the specific Mini SAS interface (SFF-8087, etc) is what is compatible with your card
