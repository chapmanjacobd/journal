<p>why do they say that many routers will need to be replaced</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Realistically this is because there is a lot of different equipment (model numbers * manufacturers). It is costly to make firmware updates and at some point things become deprecated.</p>
<p>For simple equipment a patch to fix this might be relatively small--certain government agencies might even already have patches for these backdoors but they aren't going to make that information public so we all have to suffer.</p>
<p>It takes 4-8 hours just to check if a single line (voice-only phoneset + wires) is bugged. So it also might just be the case that it's cheaper to replace it but it still takes time to replace equipment.</p>
