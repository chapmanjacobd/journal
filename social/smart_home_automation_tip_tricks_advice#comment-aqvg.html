<p>I've been very pleased with the Reolink product line. I got the RLC-510WA. Cost about $70. No subscription. I would be surprised if it needs WiFi after the initial set it up--but best to double check. But I can vouch for the quality/value of their products</p>
<p>edit: yes they should work without wifi: <a href="https://support.reolink.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007170094-Can-Reolink-WiFi-cameras-work-without-WiFi-or-Internet-connection/">https://support.reolink.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007170094-Can-Reolink-WiFi-cameras-work-without-WiFi-or-Internet-connection/</a></p>
