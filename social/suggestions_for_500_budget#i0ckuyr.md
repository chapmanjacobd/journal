Do you actively use both monitors at once? There are many sub-$100 Mobile Stand Up Desks. I had the same budget and had enough space for two desks so I have one monitor on a sitting desk and use the mobile desk for standing. Just an option to consider. There are definitely pros and cons. 

If you are going to spend $500 you might want to look a little more. There are many high quality motorized desks at the $700-$800 price point
