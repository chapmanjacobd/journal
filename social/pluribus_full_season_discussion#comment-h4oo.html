<p>Just finished watching episode nine and I'm happy with a lot of the ideas that were explored but also feel like a lot of the interesting exploration of this hivemind culture was side-stepped to get through all of the plot development that needs to happen to situate characters into their context.</p>
<p>There were several scenes that seemed to predict my plotline cynicism like "what are they going to show once he hits the Darién Gap?" and then they actually show Menousos going through the Darién Gap. Or when Carol lights up a bunch of fireworks and I think "that looks dangerous" are they trying to get both characters to end up in a hospital together? and then my prediction is subverted but the scene actually works out really well to show how the different characters are feeling in the moment.</p>
<p>The dystopia that the hivemind would rather starve millions of people than hurt a fly but it would also go completely out of its way to keep the city lights on for a non-hivemind individual seems a bit too forced.</p>
<p>I hope in season 2 we see more of an exploration of the pluribus culture and their quirks. I don't think the show is slow... but it does feel somewhat shallow. The show has a lot of interesting details but at the same time it's missing a lot of meat?</p>
<p>You could say it's a show about an alien invasion and a woman that wants her Sprouts back! The lack of existential conflict is due in large part to the asymmetric imbalance in resources between the pluribus and Carol. Instead of a detective thriller that has a lot of cunning intrigue following along the same thought as finding "the perfect wish to outsmart a genie", we get a much more grounded, slow?, and boring? (but much more real) story about a romance novelist vs. the world.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to see what the pluribus does once it is done building the big antennae... does it just kill off all the humans?</p>
