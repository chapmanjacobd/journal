<p>This site is really funny and fun to think about... I don't know if it was ever real--I don't think it was--but it could have been. It feels like an art installation.</p>
<p>If you go to <code>view-source:https://shrmntoys.anemon.es/mom/submit</code> then you can see a custom made 404 page which links to <a href="https://shrmntoys.anemon.es/assets/snap.mp4">snap.mp4</a> and <a href="https://shrmntoys.anemon.es/assets/idiots.mp3">idiots.mp3</a> which makes it seem like, to me, that the site is just a joke and it never even "worked" even as an art installation. OR maybe it was real and someone said something rude AND THEN the artist calls us idiots. That may also be possible...</p>
<p>BUT! It is still funny to read the hypothetical chat log. The feels. I should text my mom.</p>
