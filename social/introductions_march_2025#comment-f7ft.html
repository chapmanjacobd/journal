<p>I'm interested in offline tools to work with and organize data (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/">/r/selfhosted</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/datahoarder/">/r/datahoarder</a>, but also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/">/r/dataengineering</a>). I spent a lot of my free time over the past few years adding to <a href="https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/library">this</a> "library" project--whenever I used an ad-hoc script more than a couple times I'd figure out a way to add that as a subcommand.</p>
<p>I've been a Linux fanboy ever since my older brother brought home a KNOPPIX 3 CD</p>
<p>Recently, I discovered the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Mary_2">Queen Mary 2</a> and have been daydreaming an 8-day transatlantic from New York to the UK even though I know it is detrimental to the environment, mostly 70+ year old co-passengers, and not even that luxurious of a voyage--it still has some marginally diminishing mystique as it occupies my headspace these last couple days. I've never been on a big boat except the ferry to Mackinac Island.</p>
<p><strong>A/S/L (age/(gender|pronouns|identifier)/location)</strong></p>
<p>30/M/Central Illinois (thinking about moving to a bigger city like Peoria or Bloomington but I already live in a really great small town--I'm torn)</p>
<p><strong>What do you do? This could be in your spare time, for work, your passions.</strong></p>
<p>It would be really awesome to have a job that requires me to investigate some "small" data (eg. Excel, CSV, JSON, etc) to really flesh out the <code>plot</code> and <code>eda</code> library subcommands.</p>
<p>I also like working with GIS data (spatial data engineering) and doing exploratory analysis or scaling up existing processes.</p>
<p>Right now I'm <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PovertyFIRE/">r/PovertyFIRE</a> retired but still doing consulting gigs when the opportunity presents itself. I keep applying to interesting jobs too but haven't had much success with that so just trying to make the most out of every day and building out my own life purpose :-)</p>
<p><strong>Do you want other users to PM/DM you from this thread?</strong></p>
<p>Sure, I've never been PM'd</p>
<p><strong>Give us a fun fact</strong></p>
<p>Only 1% of the corn grown in the USA is sweet corn (the corn you eat). The other 99% of corn grown in the USA is field corn which is fairly inedible. This field corn is also what they use for non-edible corn products: ethanol, paint, cosmetics, etc.</p>
