this is pretty cool. I second the trackball request

I've done something similar in the past when I used windows. I had AutoHotKey do page-down when I held the right mouse button and clicked the left button. and page-up with reverse. holding down the right button and clicking the middle button would send control+w to close a tab. and my favorite one was holding down the right button and scrolling which would spam the scroll action so things would scroll much faster both up or down
