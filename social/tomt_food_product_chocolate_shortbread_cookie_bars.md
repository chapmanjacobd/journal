This would be sometime around 2006 or so. I remember eating cookie bars which were about as thick as a poptart and the bottom half of it tasted about the same as poptart crust. The top half was chocolate and caramel or chocolate and m&ms. This was a commercial product, but I haven't ever seen them again. I remember eating them fairly regularly for about a year while I was in Denver, CO.
