<p>Roy Wood co-founded Electric Light Orchestra with Jeff Lynne</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When they eventually recorded Main Street (or Wizzo as it was originally to be called) in 1976, the group had rather slipped out of the public eye and was on the point of disbanding. The single, also credited to Roy Wood's Wizzard, "Indiana Rainbow" (backed by a non-album track "The Thing Is This (This Is The Thing)"), released in March 1976, did not make the BBC Radio 1 playlist. As a result, Jet Records, to whom Wood was signed at the time, cancelled the album's release. The tapes only came to light in 1999 and, with Wood's blessing, released by Edsel, a re-issue label which specialised largely in licensing long-deleted albums from major companies and had recently made Introducing Eddy &amp; the Falcons, available on CD for the first time.</p>
