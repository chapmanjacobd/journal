<p>I was reading through <a href="https://winther.sysctl.dk/can-three-starving-piglets-be-called-art/">an essay</a> this morning and was curious what the end result was <del>(one benefit of reading the news late!). The day after the essay was written (timezones?) it seems like people had enough of the art!</del> (it seems I've swapped cause and effect)</p>
<p>The artist, however, is mostly unfazed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Evaristti says he is already developing ways to revive the exhibition. One idea is to steal dead piglets from meat processing plants and present them to the public. He also wants to buy another three piglets — not to starve, but to auction to the highest bidder promising them a happy life.</p>
<p>"I got a lot of hate messages from around the world — I think people don't get that my art is about animals rights," Evaristti said.</p>
