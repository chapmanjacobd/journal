I have a friend I'm trying to find this for. He describes it as follows:

It was given to us, the Crimean Samokish art college students, for free about 20 years ago. I haven’t since seen it on sale anywhere. Don’t know what I’m gonna do when I'm out of it.

I haven't seen it in art stores. Even back then it was considered technical or wrapping paper, not drawing paper.

The paper is completely opaque, pretty thick, but not as thick as cardboard. It's rough to touch, but not quite like sandpaper.

I call it “wooden” for the countless tiny splinters of wood it contains, making its surface rough.
