I used to do this multiple times a day ~10 years ago. I was very productive with it and the Android app I used was very efficient. Unfortunately, it wasn't ever updated for Android Honeycomb and I wasn't ever able to find a replacement app that was as good as the first one I tried.

Also, I've moved to Linux since then. Nomachine is decent but their app doesn't work with SSH proxy. I guess RDP is just one of those things that Windows does really well. Everything else just feels kinda kludgy in comparison
