<p>There's three components to my setup:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>When I find a list of interesting links I save them to a links database:</p>
<p>$ <a href="https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/computer/blob/main/bin/cb">cb</a> | <a href="https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/library?tab=readme-ov-file#links-add">library links-add</a> ~/mc/links.db --skip-extract -</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This isn't anything special but the command will let me know how many links were new or previously saved which is useful when the <em>Copy All Links</em> Firefox extension doesn't work so I know I need to try copying the links again, etc.</p>
<p>If links have useful description as their link text. I'll do something like this to capture that as well:</p>
<pre><code>$ library linksdb ~/mc/tv.db --local-html (cb -t text/html | psub)
</code></pre>
<p>Right now I have 110,672 links... which will take me 34 years, 16 days and 8 hours to get through at my current rate. But that number keeps growing so... probably won't ever read some of these.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><a href="https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/library?tab=readme-ov-file#regex-sort">Regex-sort</a>. This is a bit technical but I feel like it is a big reason why I'm able to find very long-tail things. Having the additional metadata like page title helps here as that is fed in as additional text.</li>
</ol>
<p>Basically it is a text processor where all the words in each line (or dict values in the case of links) are enriched (eg. compared to the corpus as a whole, etc)/sorted within the line before sorting all the lines.</p>

usage: library regex-sort [input_path | stdin] [output_path | stdout]

    regex-sort is effectively a text-processing pipeline with the following steps:

    line_splitter -- split lines into "words" (--regex)
    word_sorter -- sort words within each line (--word-sort)
    line_sorter -- sort lines (--line-sort)

    Examples:

        If your data has a lot of repeating rows it will help to sort by dup count:
            --line-sort dup,natsort

        You can use any matching regex to produce sorting words:
            --regex \b\w\w+\b  # word boundaries (default)
            --regex \b\d+\b    # digits
            --regex '.{3}'     # char counts

            --regex '.{3}' --line-sort dup,natsort -v
            (0, ((' Ja',), ('Sva',), ('aye',), ('lba',), ('n M',), ('rd ',)))  # Svalbard and Jan Mayen
            (0, ((' La',), ('Sri',), ('nka',)))  # Sri Lanka
            (0, ((' Ma',), ('San',), ('rin',)))  # San Marino
            (0, ((' Ri',), ('Pue',), ('rto',)))  # Puerto Rico
            (0, (('And',), ('orr',)))  # Andorra
            (0, (('Arm',), ('eni',)))  # Armenia

        You can use 'mcda' as a strategy for ranking multiple sort score criteria:
            --word-sorts '-dup, mcda, count, -len, -lastindex, alpha' \\  # count, -len, -lastindex, alpha are weighted by entropy
            --line-sorts '-allunique, alpha, mcda, alldup, dupmode, line'  # alldup, dupmode, line are weighted by entropy

...

Regex-sort options:
  --regexs (-re)         Default eliminates common URL chars like `-,_.` and use word breaks to build words
    STRING
  --word-sorts (-wu)            Specify the word sorting strategy to use within each line
    STRING
                                Choose ONE OR MORE of the following options:

                                  len        length of word
