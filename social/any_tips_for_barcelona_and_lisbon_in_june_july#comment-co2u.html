<p>The wife and I spent two weeks in Barcelona. Here are some thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>We both thought <em>Casa Batlló</em> and <em>Casa Vicens</em> are the most interesting of Gaudi's works.</li>
<li>Definitely spend a few hours enjoying the surrounding streetscape (Pg de Gràcia): the streetlamp-benches are very neat. They are designed by Pere Falqués but definitely Gaudi-style.</li>
<li><em>Cripta de la Colònia Güell</em> is also interesting and worth a day-trip if you have the time.</li>
<li>Our favorite eats: Restaurante <em>Arcano</em> (nice budget prix fixe lunch/dinner; reservations recommended), <em>En Ville</em>, Restaurant <em>La Taverneta</em> (it is pretty unassuming but the food has a certain <em>he ne sais quoi</em>). <em>El Nacional</em> is definitely worth a visit--the food is average but the mood of the restaurant is really interesting--kind of BioShock vibes. Neko Sushi is not bad if you need some emergency sushi</li>
<li>Go on a walking tour! They are generally entertaining enough and can give you some historical insight into the city like pointing out the roman aqueducts as you walk by, etc.</li>
