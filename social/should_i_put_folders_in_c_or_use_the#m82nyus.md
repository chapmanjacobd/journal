Yeah, I would keep things under the home directory but limit it to one or two folders for the sake of your own sanity: `C:/users/username/projects` or  `C:/users/username/data/`

The system provided ones like `Documents` and `Pictures` are also useful, but I don't like how they write random files into them. I don't recommend putting files directly on `C:\` due to additional permissions requirements but nothing should go wrong if you choose to do so.
