<p>And I wonder how much control you will really have over this. Right now your consent is not required except in some cases when you are subject to GDPR / CCPA and when the website can verify that you are actually subject to GDPR / CCPA. The big sites are pretty good at this but small sites are pretty hopeless.</p>
<p>But maybe increased verification will have the opposite effect that greedy people want. While it will decrease anonymity, <em>it may actually increase the rights that people have over their data</em>--especially if the big sites are not allowed to profile neither non-logged in users and there is no notion of "non-verified"  users.</p>
