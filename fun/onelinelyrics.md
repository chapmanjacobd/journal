# lyrics

full aftertaste
serpentine computer
well-groomed aerobics
severe protection
plastic calligraphy
hungry approximation
helpless-warfare
unfit loan

I'll be your brief marine,
I'll be your damaged arabic... homework.
I'll be your mundane allergy.

We could transfer some files
We could ride cable cars
but that would be expensive
that would be expensive in Mars

fake user blender

Some things are more and some things are less

Double blind cause I closed both of my eyes

You must remember the most important thing in life which is to drink water

it rained just for you

...until we remember How many songs have been sung that will never be played again or how many books have been written that will never be read again...

another such victory and we are undone

If you're gonna be outside might as well get some sun even if it's just a rainy day

And if i die tomorrow, the stock price will go down

You wouldn't remember
how to drive a car

give me the face of jean michel jarre
so that I'll know that all my girls are safe
stuck in traffic, stuck in meetings
stuck in traffic, stuck in meetings

oh didn't you hear? stocks only go up now

my celestial form is hot but my body now is not

I can solve other people's loneliness. But I can't solve my own loneliness

The best spies are the ones who do not know they are spies
