> WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BE WHEN YOU GROW UP? The first person who asked me that question was my friend David Driver. We were standing outside the door of our house in Latimer Road. We were either pre-school age or in our first or second year at school. The incident stuck in my mind because the question shocked me. It had never occurred to me before that I would grow up. I had assumed that I would always be a child, that there were parents, who had always been adults, and children who would always be children. Dave knew better; but he was ten-and-a-half months older than I, despite us being in the same class at school. Every child is asked that question from time to time. The question highlights a fundamental fact about human existence or, rather, about what it is to be a person.
> Each person has to discover for himself what sort of life will suit him. Other persons can make more or less informed guesses about the kind of life that will suit Danny; and Danny may be grateful for some of the suggestions. But whether or not a suggested kind of life is actually suitable for Danny can only be settled by Danny himself, and only by experience. If Danny attempts to live a kind of life but hates it or cannot make a success of it, then that kind of life is not suitable for him. Each person faces the same fundamental problem: to discover, by experimentation, who he is. Some people, it seems, never try to solve that fundamental problem. Instead they accept a description of themselves that has been foisted on them by others. They live a kind of life that they have been told is right for them. That is especially so in 'closed' societies, in which everyone conforms to inherited traditions. But even in 'open' societies, in which persons have the option of choosing for themselves which sort of life to live, there are many people who do not take that option. Either under pressure from others or due to their own timidity, they just conform to some social expectation.

> Safety is an emergent property of systems; it does not reside in a person, device or
department of an organization or system. Safety cannot be purchased or manufactured; it
is not a feature that is separate from the other components of the system. This means that
safety cannot be manipulated like a feedstock or raw material. The state of safety in any
system is always dynamic; continuous systemic change insures that hazard and its
management are constantly changing.

As we understand it, the sacrifice of war is not about achieving a goal through force, but giving lives to the blood god. We sacrifice enough lives, we Win. While you're there, to pass the time, you'll get to kill anyone you see, attack innocent animals, whatever you like, but the important part is that you don't come home. If you come home, you will be redeployed again and again until you don't. If you are injured but alive, you have screwed up your mission in the worst way and we will be punish you for it."

> One thing that is tricky for stakeholders to appreciate is how the scientific method can't prove a negative. If you mention it they'll pause and think about it and say it makes sense, but the implications of the fact are a bit remote from their experience. So they can get confused when faced with the fact that our work ending in not in a negative or positive result but just "inconclusive".
> They often try to push to get some kind of partial result they can use, something "directional" perhaps, or permission to rule out the existence of an effect. But inconclusive means exactly that, we just don't have the information to come to a conclusion. We get almost nothing.
> For people who've done research before, this is just part of the process. But in the eyes of a stakeholder, do it often enough and it's a sign of failure and wasted effort. The only consolation prize is that we might have better data policies and collection methods to show for it thanks to all the issues we uncovered along the way.

> Conservatives see the society as dysfunctional, immoral and nonsensical or impossible to understand and their ideology offers them hope for change: we'll revert society to the way it was and be happy again. But this is obviously impossible: they could only approach it by completely eradicating the progressives, so they'll never be happy and it'll be easy to distract them from more important issues by feeding them hate against their enemies.
> Western hyperprogressives, for different reasons, see the society as dysfunctional, immoral and cruel, especially towards various minorities. As with the conservatives' grievances, there is truth in that. Their ideology offers them a different hope for change: we'll transform this backwards society, teach it to accept previously oppressed identities and create a world where everyone has their basic needs met, including respect and acceptance.
> But doing this in a relatively short time, if ever, and by policing the rest of the society, is impossible, and the only way to do it would be by completely eradicating the conservatives. Same as above, that is never going to happen, so this ideology too has to lead to some level of constant and unsolvable unhappiness and frustration.

> The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. ...We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. This is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organized. Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a smoothly functioning society. ...In almost every act of our daily lives, whether in the sphere of politics or business, in our social conduct or our ethical thinking, we are dominated by the relatively small number of persons... who understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses.

> One key symptom of the imperative to optimize all areas of human experience for efficiency (modern life) is the displacement of ends by a fixation on means, so much so that means themselves become ends. The smooth and efficient operation of the system becomes more important than reckoning with which goods should be pursued. Why something ought to be done comes to matter less than that it can be done _and faster_.
> The deluge of information through which we all slog everyday is not hospitable to the ideals of objectivity and impartiality, which to some degree were artifacts of print and mass media ecosystems. The present condition of information super-abundance and troves of easily searchable memory databases makes it trivially easy to either expose actual instances of bias, self-interest, inconsistency, and outright hypocrisy or to generate (unwittingly for yourself or intentionally for others) the appearance of such. In the age of the Database, no one controls the Narrative. And while narratives proliferate and consolidate along a predictable array of partisan and factional lines, the notion that the competing claims could be adjudicated objectively or impartially is defeated by exhaustion.

> I became blind in 2009 and since then I’ve had profound experiences of what’s called the Charles Bonnet syndrome. It’s a very little-known thing that happens to thousands of people all over the world. Even my doctor never heard of it. She said, “I thought you couldn’t see.” I said, “I can’t see!” Because I’m describing these hallucinations to her. Basically, when you’re awake, or sometimes when you come out of sleeping but usually when you’re awake – and I’ve had this happen for several years now – if you’ve been sighted your whole life and you suddenly become blind in middle age, your brain continues to want that visual stimulus, so it makes its own. So what you see are people, that you don’t know, who are not transparent except if you tried to reach out and touch them. They appear to be maybe just walking through your room. You don’t know who they are, they’re smiling, they’re nice. It’s not frightening at all, except it’s unusual to say the least, especially the first time it happens. Sometimes it’s hallucinations, like a British double-decker bus appearing in your kitchen, things like that.

> The naive view sees information as an attempt to represent reality. It is aware that some information doesn’t represent reality well, but it dismisses this as unfortunate cases of”misinformation” or”disinformation.” Misinformation is an honest mistake, occurring when someone tries to represent reality but gets it wrong. Disinformation is a deliberate lie, occurring when someone consciously intends to distort our view of reality.
>
> According to the naive view, astronomers derive”real information” from the stars, while the information that astrologers imagine to read in constellations is either”misinformation” or”disinformation.” If only people were given more information about the universe, surely they would abandon astrology altogether. But the fact is that for thousands of years astrology has had a huge impact on history, and today millions of people still check their star signs before making the most important decisions of their lives, like what to study and whom to marry. As of 2021, the global astrology market was valued at $ 12.8 billion.
>
> What the example of astrology illustrates is that errors, lies, fantasies, and fictions are information, too. Contrary to what the naive view of information says, information has no essential link to truth, and its role in history isn’t to represent a preexisting reality. Rather, what information does is to create new realities by tying together disparate things— whether couples or empires. Its defining feature is connection rather than representation, and information is whatever connects different points into a network. Information doesn’t necessarily inform us about things. Rather, it puts things in formation. Horoscopes put lovers in astrological formations, propaganda broadcasts put voters in political formations, and marching songs put soldiers in military formations.

> There is something fundamentally immoral to presenting a narrative that people build their entire lives upon. They decide what to do with their education, how much money to give, who to marry, when to marry, how many kids to have, what professions to pursue. There’s this massive amount of decisions that you make—in a finite life. And to base that life on a narrative—when not only the narrative isn’t what it claims to be, but when the leaders know that the narrative isn’t what it claims to be, and intentionally, for as long as they could, withheld the information that would allow people to make an informed decision about how they spend their finite time and resources—is profoundly immoral.
