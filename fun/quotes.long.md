I don't fully agree with all of these but many of the statements are thought-provoking.

> WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BE WHEN YOU GROW UP? The first person who asked me that question was my friend David Driver. We were standing outside the door of our house in Latimer Road. We were either pre-school age or in our first or second year at school. The incident stuck in my mind because the question shocked me. It had never occurred to me before that I would grow up. I had assumed that I would always be a child, that there were parents, who had always been adults, and children who would always be children. Dave knew better; but he was ten-and-a-half months older than I, despite us being in the same class at school. Every child is asked that question from time to time. The question highlights a fundamental fact about human existence or, rather, about what it is to be a person. 
> Each person has to discover for himself what sort of life will suit him. Other persons can make more or less informed guesses about the kind of life that will suit Danny; and Danny may be grateful for some of the suggestions. But whether or not a suggested kind of life is actually suitable for Danny can only be settled by Danny himself, and only by experience. If Danny attempts to live a kind of life but hates it or cannot make a success of it, then that kind of life is not suitable for him. Each person faces the same fundamental problem: to discover, by experimentation, who he is. Some people, it seems, never try to solve that fundamental problem. Instead they accept a description of themselves that has been foisted on them by others. They live a kind of life that they have been told is right for them. That is especially so in 'closed' societies, in which everyone conforms to inherited traditions. But even in 'open' societies, in which persons have the option of choosing for themselves which sort of life to live, there are many people who do not take that option. Either under pressure from others or due to their own timidity, they just conform to some social expectation.

> Today in my Jazz Styles and Analysis class, we discussed how so many of us musicians worry about what the audience, our peers, and our teachers think of our playing, our interpretations, our technique, or our improvisations.

> For the moments you're alone, there's a secret to a little pleasant satisfaction. When it's hard to put thoughts into words or you're feeling all pent up, write your thoughts down.

> Words might just flow onto those blank sheets. Suddenly, you're a philosopher, a counselor, an artist, or merely someone who needs to organize overwhelming thoughts.

> I suggest using your favorite pen. The process is more enjoyable that way. Honestly, even though I'm surrounded by people I call friends, I don't feel entirely secure. Inside my head, I'm screaming. I don't think I'm the only one who feels this way. The feeling makes my heart want to burst, to find refuge and serenity. Somehow I'll throw away my insecurities.

> พอมีไฟ ก็สุมไฟให้ลุกโชน
> เราก็ใช้วิธีนี้กับตัวเองเหมือนกัน เวลาติดซีรีย์ ติดเกมส์ ติดกิน etc. ถ้าอยากเลิกคือจะปล่อยให้ตัวเองใช้เวลาจมอยู่กับมันทั้งวันทั้งคืน อยากนอนค่อยนอน
> แต่พอทำไป จะพบว่ามันมีผลลัพธ์ออกมาเป็น 2 แบบใหญ่ๆ

1. ไฟมอด เกิดการเบื่อหน่ายและเลิกไปพักใหญ่ เพราะถ้ามันมากเกินไป รู้สึกทำไปชีวิตไม่พัฒนา เช่น เกมส์ จีบบ่าว(
   ) กิน อ่านการ์ตูน ดูซีรีย์ etc. (
2. ทำได้ยาวไม่รู้สึกเบื่อ เกิดพัฒนาการแบบก้าวกระโดด เช่น วาดรูป เรียนภาษา จัดบ้าน ทำขนม คิดกิจกรรม งานฝีมือ etc.(ชั้นนี่เกิดมาเป็นแม่บ้านชัดๆ) \*แต่ต้องตั้งเป้าและประเมินผลงานด้วยนะ
   ข้อเสียคือ....มันคือการเดินเข้าห้องตัวเอง ปิดประตูสู่โลกภายนอก อยู่กับตัวเองยาวไป หมกไปเลย งานที่ควรทำถูกเท การกระทำแบบนี้ทำได้สักพักต้องหยุด ดึงตัวเองออกมา เพราะงานข้างนอกที่ต้องรับผิดชอบคือไฟลนหรือจะพังไปหมดแล้ว .....นี่มันคือสิ่งที่คนอื่นเขาเรียกว่า "คนติ๊ด" ใช่มั้ย

> As you get older, you will increasingly fear losing power, and you will become bitter, defensive, and angry about change. Curiosity, acceptance, and exposure to new people can help with this. But, man are you ever going to get weird about people with purple hair who are not afraid of you.
> Related: almost no one has ever actually been afraid of you.
> Relatedly related: the only people who were ever actually afraid of you were the handful of people who loved you and desperately wanted you to love them back.
> For chrissakes, get a new kitchen sponge already.
> Some people like to tell you what to pay attention to. Many want to determine how you should feel about it. Others specialize in advising exactly what you should do as a result. Just be aware that these are each different things, and it's probably wise to avoid people who are adamant about demanding to control all three.
> Related: being good at one of these things rarely means someone's also great at the others.

> Related: This also goes for almost everything else.

> Safety is an emergent property of systems; it does not reside in a person, device or
department of an organization or system. Safety cannot be purchased or manufactured; it
is not a feature that is separate from the other components of the system. This means that
safety cannot be manipulated like a feedstock or raw material. The state of safety in any
system is always dynamic; continuous systemic change insures that hazard and its
management are constantly changing.

> At the end of the day, none of us knows how much time we have left on this earth. What that means is that we can't wait for something to allow us to live a fulfilling life - we need to find fulfillment in what we do.
> And we don't need much to find that fulfillment, because the deepest fulfillment tends to come from helping others. Whether it's raising good kids, shoveling your neighbor's driveway, becoming a doctor, whatever - all of these can be fulfilling and none require much at all.

> Everything I ever saw, heard, or read about about the Iraq War suggested to me this pattern: "Your objective, soldier, is to die. As we understand it, the sacrifice of war is not about achieving a goal through force, but giving lives to the blood god. We sacrifice enough lives, we Win. While you're there, to pass the time, you'll get to kill anyone you see, attack innocent animals, whatever you like, but the important part is that you don't come home. If you come home, you will be redeployed again and again until you don't. If you are injured but alive, you have screwed up your mission in the worst way and we will be punish you for it."

> One thing that is tricky for stakeholders to appreciate is how the scientific method can't prove a negative. If you mention it they'll pause and think about it and say it makes sense, but the implications of the fact are a bit remote from their experience. So they can get confused when faced with the fact that our work ending in not in a negative or positive result but just "inconclusive".
> They often try to push to get some kind of partial result they can use, something "directional" perhaps, or permission to rule out the existence of an effect. But inconclusive means exactly that, we just don't have the information to come to a conclusion. We get almost nothing.
> For people who've done research before, this is just part of the process. But in the eyes of a stakeholder, do it often enough and it's a sign of failure and wasted effort. The only consolation prize is that we might have better data policies and collection methods to show for it thanks to all the issues we uncovered along the way.

> Conservatives see the society as dysfunctional, immoral and nonsensical or impossible to understand and their ideology offers them hope for change: we'll revert society to the way it was and be happy again. But this is obviously impossible: they could only approach it by completely eradicating the progressives, so they'll never be happy and it'll be easy to distract them from more important issues by feeding them hate against their enemies.
> Western hyperprogressives, for different reasons, see the society as dysfunctional, immoral and cruel, especially towards various minorities. As with the conservatives' grievances, there is truth in that. Their ideology offers them a different hope for change: we'll transform this backwards society, teach it to accept previously oppressed identities and create a world where everyone has their basic needs met, including respect and acceptance.
> But doing this in a relatively short time, if ever, and by policing the rest of the society, is impossible, and the only way to do it would be by completely eradicating the conservatives. Same as above, that is never going to happen, so this ideology too has to lead to some level of constant and unsolvable unhappiness and frustration.
