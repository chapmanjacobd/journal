> WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BE WHEN YOU GROW UP? The first person who asked me that question was my friend David Driver. We were standing outside the door of our house in Latimer Road. We were either pre-school age or in our first or second year at school. The incident stuck in my mind because the question shocked me. It had never occurred to me before that I would grow up. I had assumed that I would always be a child, that there were parents, who had always been adults, and children who would always be children. Dave knew better; but he was ten-and-a-half months older than I, despite us being in the same class at school. Every child is asked that question from time to time. The question highlights a fundamental fact about human existence or, rather, about what it is to be a person.
> Each person has to discover for himself what sort of life will suit him. Other persons can make more or less informed guesses about the kind of life that will suit Danny; and Danny may be grateful for some of the suggestions. But whether or not a suggested kind of life is actually suitable for Danny can only be settled by Danny himself, and only by experience. If Danny attempts to live a kind of life but hates it or cannot make a success of it, then that kind of life is not suitable for him. Each person faces the same fundamental problem: to discover, by experimentation, who he is. Some people, it seems, never try to solve that fundamental problem. Instead they accept a description of themselves that has been foisted on them by others. They live a kind of life that they have been told is right for them. That is especially so in 'closed' societies, in which everyone conforms to inherited traditions. But even in 'open' societies, in which persons have the option of choosing for themselves which sort of life to live, there are many people who do not take that option. Either under pressure from others or due to their own timidity, they just conform to some social expectation.

department of an organization or system. Safety cannot be purchased or manufactured; it
is not a feature that is separate from the other components of the system. This means that
safety cannot be manipulated like a feedstock or raw material. The state of safety in any
system is always dynamic; continuous systemic change insures that hazard and its
management are constantly changing.

> Conservatives see the society as dysfunctional, immoral and nonsensical or impossible to understand and their ideology offers them hope for change: we'll revert society to the way it was and be happy again. But this is obviously impossible: they could only approach it by completely eradicating the progressives, so they'll never be happy and it'll be easy to distract them from more important issues by feeding them hate against their enemies.
> Western hyperprogressives, for different reasons, see the society as dysfunctional, immoral and cruel, especially towards various minorities. As with the conservatives' grievances, there is truth in that. Their ideology offers them a different hope for change: we'll transform this backwards society, teach it to accept previously oppressed identities and create a world where everyone has their basic needs met, including respect and acceptance.
> But doing this in a relatively short time, if ever, and by policing the rest of the society, is impossible, and the only way to do it would be by completely eradicating the conservatives.

> One key symptom of the imperative to optimize all areas of human experience for efficiency (modern life) is the displacement of ends by a fixation on means, so much so that means themselves become ends. The smooth and efficient operation of the system becomes more important than reckoning with which goods should be pursued. Why something ought to be done comes to matter less than that it can be done _and faster_.
> The deluge of information through which we all slog everyday is not hospitable to the ideals of objectivity and impartiality, which to some degree were artifacts of print and mass media ecosystems. The present condition of information super-abundance and troves of easily searchable memory databases makes it trivially easy to either expose actual instances of bias, self-interest, inconsistency, and outright hypocrisy or to generate (unwittingly for yourself or intentionally for others) the appearance of such. In the age of the Database, no one controls the Narrative. And while narratives proliferate and consolidate along a predictable array of partisan and factional lines, the notion that the competing claims could be adjudicated objectively or impartially is defeated by exhaustion.

> I became blind in 2009 and since then I’ve had profound experiences of what’s called the Charles Bonnet syndrome. It’s a very little-known thing that happens to thousands of people all over the world. Even my doctor never heard of it. She said, “I thought you couldn’t see.” I said, “I can’t see!” Because I’m describing these hallucinations to her. Basically, when you’re awake, or sometimes when you come out of sleeping but usually when you’re awake – and I’ve had this happen for several years now – if you’ve been sighted your whole life and you suddenly become blind in middle age, your brain continues to want that visual stimulus, so it makes its own. So what you see are people, that you don’t know, who are not transparent except if you tried to reach out and touch them. They appear to be maybe just walking through your room. You don’t know who they are, they’re smiling, they’re nice. It’s not frightening at all, except it’s unusual to say the least, especially the first time it happens. Sometimes it’s hallucinations, like a British double-decker bus appearing in your kitchen, things like that.

> The naive view sees information as an attempt to represent reality. It is aware that some information doesn’t represent reality well, but it dismisses this as unfortunate cases of”misinformation” or”disinformation.” Misinformation is an honest mistake, occurring when someone tries to represent reality but gets it wrong. Disinformation is a deliberate lie, occurring when someone consciously intends to distort our view of reality.
>
> According to the naive view, astronomers derive”real information” from the stars, while the information that astrologers imagine to read in constellations is either”misinformation” or”disinformation.” If only people were given more information about the universe, surely they would abandon astrology altogether. But the fact is that for thousands of years astrology has had a huge impact on history, and today millions of people still check their star signs before making the most important decisions of their lives, like what to study and whom to marry. As of 2021, the global astrology market was valued at $ 12.8 billion.
>
> What the example of astrology illustrates is that errors, lies, fantasies, and fictions are information, too. Contrary to what the naive view of information says, information has no essential link to truth, and its role in history isn’t to represent a preexisting reality. Rather, what information does is to create new realities by tying together disparate things— whether couples or empires. Its defining feature is connection rather than representation, and information is whatever connects different points into a network. Information doesn’t necessarily inform us about things. Rather, it puts things in formation. Horoscopes put lovers in astrological formations, propaganda broadcasts put voters in political formations, and marching songs put soldiers in military formations.

> There is something fundamentally immoral to presenting a narrative that people build their entire lives upon. They decide what to do with their education, how much money to give, who to marry, when to marry, how many kids to have, what professions to pursue. There’s this massive amount of decisions that you make—in a finite life. And to base that life on a narrative—when not only the narrative isn’t what it claims to be, but when the leaders know that the narrative isn’t what it claims to be, and intentionally, for as long as they could, withheld the information that would allow people to make an informed decision about how they spend their finite time and resources—is profoundly immoral.

> Jessica Taylor, an AI researcher who knew both Zizians and participants in Leverage Research, put it bluntly. “There’s this belief [among rationalists],” she said, “that society has these really bad behaviors, like developing self-improving AI, or that mainstream epistemology is really bad–not just religion, but also normal ‘trust-the-experts’ science. That can lead to the idea that we should figure it out ourselves. And what can show up is that some people aren't actually smart enough to form very good conclusions once they start thinking for themselves.”
>
> One way that thinking for yourself goes wrong is that you realize your society is wrong about something, don’t realize that you can’t outperform it, and wind up even wronger. But another potential failure is that, knowing both that your society is wrong and that you can’t do better, you start looking for someone even more right. Paradoxically, the desire to ignore the experts can make rationalists more vulnerable to a charismatic leader.

> I have this toy model of the world that I keep in my mind, of cultures as a big game that is played by elites, a SimCulture if you will. I’ve alluded to it many times, and yes, I understand it’s oversimplified, but it helps me frame things. If you think of it that way, then you start asking, what’s the point of the game? How do you “win?” That is, what are you, the person playing the game, trying to accomplish? And I would say “winning” means providing fulfilling lives for the largest percentage of your citizens. Since I don’t believe every citizen is the same in terms of capacity/interest/capabilities, your culture has to work for a lot of different personality types, intelligence levels, and dispositions. It should fulfill both the top of the class and the bottom, and I believe Catholicism, or the intellectual and cultural framework around it, does that.

I can’t give you a precise answer, because I don’t believe I’m smart enough, but I do think that it’s about the spiritual. That is, material wealth alone will never be fulfilling. There needs to be something transcendent. Something beyond the here and now.

> To pontificate for a little bit more, I’m leaving in two days for China, and I believe no matter what else I think about the CCP, they do understand all of this. Maybe not the Catholic part, but the idea that there is an elite who build culture and that elite should have a goal in mind. The CCP of course sees themselves as that elite, and as I’ve written before, that self-recognition is, in my opinion, better than pretending, like the West does, that elites don’t shape culture, and consequently they don’t take their “jobs” seriously, so they don’t really know, or understand, what they want. What I believe Western elites want, judging from their policies and rhetoric, is maximum individual freedom for everyone. Which I believe is an incoherent telos. People are social creatures, and are only understandable within the context of a community, and so maximum individual freedom is a misguided goal. It feels good for most of the ride, but you’re going in the wrong direction, towards isolation, and away from the meaningful. It’s like driving in a really snazzy convertible deeper and deeper into the desert; the ride feels great until at some point you realize you’re utterly alone, which is immensely depressing.

> So the game they are now playing is not only going in the wrong direction, it is also not working at the day to day level, because it is a fundamentally incoherent combination of a Libertarian understanding of the individual with a socialist vision of politics, because all politics is socialist, in the sense that citizens of a nation have to share things, but you can’t have socialist policies (a functional Nation) if your citizens don’t respect each other and something higher than themselves. You can’t share resources if you don’t feel a connection that transcends the adulation of the self.

>> Wow. OK. That sounds pretty extreme?

> No, I don’t see it that way. I see it as a simple recognition that to have nice things a society has to have some glue holding it together beyond the threat of jail. You need a moral arbiter independent of the government. Or, if you don’t have some moral underpinnings separate from the state, then you will either end up with chaos, or authoritarianism, as the state increases its role to stop the chaos.

> Although I guess my most controversial view is the vast majority of people don’t want, and cannot deal with (or don’t find contentment with) the amount of liberty, freedoms, and free choices that Western elites (philosophical Liberals) see as the end point, or peak, of social and political organization. Or, our true telos is not emancipation from all obligations, rules, and regulations, but rather that old “being a valued member of something larger than themselves” thing from a few questions ago. I do believe in that sense, the Chinese are on to something, although I would suggest that Japan, Korea, and Taiwan also understand that, and accomplish much the same thing without all the nasty repression.
