Matsuo Basho

> Just the fact that some geniuses were laughed at does not imply that all who are laughed at are geniuses. They laughed at Columbus, they laughed at Fulton, they laughed at the Wright brothers. But they also laughed at Bozo the Clown.

Jessica Joy Kerr

> Two key ingredients in scientific revolutions, then, are noticing problems and taking them seriously. Kuhn assumed scientists do both of those things naturally, and maybe that was true in 1962. But it doesn’t have to be. As fields formalize, they can get very good at ignoring and suppressing problems, delaying revolutions indefinitely.

> It's not the variance that gets you, it's the correlation." In my experience, "fat tail" risks are really about incorrect modeling of correlation.

Joseph Kaptur

> A web browser is an application that retrieves documents over a network, and renders them on a computer screen.
> To think of a web browser as more than that is insanity.

Nathan Lineback

> The process of conjecture and criticism leads to progress only when criticisms are not evaded in pseudo-scientific ways. What distinguishes science is not just that its theories are, directly or indirectly, falsifiable but also that its procedures are not ad hoc. 
> That requires that an amendment to a theory that removes an inconsistency identified by criticism is acceptable only if it solves some problem in addition to the problem of removing the inconsistency.

Danny Frederick

> The right way to do this is to continually refactor the monolith until the break up is clean and makes sense. And then do it. But if you can’t refactor the monolith to be clean and well done, you have less than zero hope for the distributed architecture.

Upton Sinclair

> One thing kids like is to be tricked. For instance, I was going to take my little nephew to Disneyland, but instead I drove him to an old burned-out warehouse. "Oh, no," I said. "Disneyland burned down." He cried and cried, but I think that deep down, he thought it was a pretty good joke. I started to drive over to the real Disneyland, but it was getting pretty late.

Jack Handey

> Consider what matters to you personally as a human being. What problem(s) in the world tug at your heart. Envision several lives, one at a time, where you've thoroughly solved each one of these problems in a separate life. How do you feel about yourself in each of these lives after achieving that end?
