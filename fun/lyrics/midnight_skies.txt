poets breathe well at the quill
die young and unafraid
revenge is wrought armchair to armchair
heavy hearts and distant cries
become lullabies in midnight skies

eyes closed dead or alive
die well young lizard: become a mountain: the thing which billionaires secretly envy
war heart torn off the sleeve,
the cuff now has dignity
old bones reconfigured blossom new ideas
