This film technique helps build a base for how they should see a past event by introducing an idea to form a perspective in the audience's mind which will drive how they interpret the remainder of the film.

Preface: (fiction) Introduction of the idea.

"...such an unbelieving and loathsome people."

Nuclear weapon launch stock footage, etc... (the transition is key)

Remainder: (documentary style, non-fiction, rural-dessert)

There is a fine line between propaganda and documentary film and raw, archive footage. The main goal of this technique is to set the mood and drive uncommon interpretation. There may be no right or wrong in history, but film enables individuals see past events from different perspectives
