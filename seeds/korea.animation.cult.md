An animation studio in Suncheon offers internships to students around the world (but also many koreans from around the world). The students arrive and everything seems fine but it is actually a secret doomsday cult and they have a human trafficking agreement with North Korea so that North Korean Kim Sang-Il (played by Kim Sung Cheol) can help expand the great leader's movie library.

On the last day of their internship the shuttle bus takes them to North Korea and they have to do animation 15 hours per day.

The parents are told that their student died and they send cremated remains back with a postcard explaining how they died. This upsets many people who don't believe in cremation.

There is a North Korean internet sweatshop dedicated to searching for posts that these parents make to prevent people from finding out that everyone who goes there dies. But this is the story of a family who is friends with another family and both sons applied and went to the animation studio. And both sons died in strange and unrelated events. They think suspicious and team up and fly to Korea to try to investigate.

...

Eventually the great leader wants to meet all the staff because the movies are so good. He gets angry when most of the people there have a south korean accent, "this isn't North Korean cinema these are not North Koreans" and tells Kim Sang-Il to send all the people back.
