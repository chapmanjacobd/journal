> Supper Club dinners are monthly and are held in rotating venues across the city. Each dinner features a thoughtfully crafted menu that strives to highlight the story of our hosts and the inspiration that drives them. Whether in a hair salon, an art gallery, or  under a string-lit canopy in an urban garden sanctuary, we visualize these spaces and dinners as a way to share stories and to deepen connections across the table, and weâ€™d love for you to join us.
