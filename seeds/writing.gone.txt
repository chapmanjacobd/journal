    can I taste my own displeasure? 
    often distant pains stem 
    not so often thought I measure 
    could life be simple again? so
    each day forgive another 
    i will give in, restructure anew
    though a tinge of sadness struck low
    end imagination, memory: its beauty, fragility 
    death to possibility: assumption is no conclusion
