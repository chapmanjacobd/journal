Thriller / Conspiracy Mystery

The US is so wide with people usually traveling vertically or horizontally

Maybe there are hidden cities 37KM at an oblique angle from most US cities

Backup cities that were started during the cold war and were never de-classified.

People there experience the same American life and are just as oblivious to our "real" cities because their maps are the opposite of ours--their empty spaces are where our cities are.
