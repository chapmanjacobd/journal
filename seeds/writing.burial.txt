    I would like the full service to be recorded in 1080p60 with one hour of pre-recording before the service officially starts.

    I would like my clothing to be laid out separately from the casket and documented specifically in the way that an archeological site would note every detail.

    I would like to be referred to as the unknown man.

    If the cost is not excessive for my estate I would like to be buried in a similar way as Gyeongju burial mounds or Ivatan boat shaped grave (combine features of both if you like) on a small secluded property. No bigger than 10 by 10 meters but no smaller than 4 by 4 meters. Bury me with a cheap medium sized bell and one medium range walkie-talkie (fully charged) tuned to channel 3 or 33. I would like no valuables to be buried with me.

    If the cost is prohibitive, I would like any option which isn't cremation.
