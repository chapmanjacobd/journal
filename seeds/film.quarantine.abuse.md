A woman arrives in Paris at the start of the pandemic. A French guy also is on the same plane. They both test positive for COVID-19 and somehow because he speaks French he is able to request that they quarantine in the same hotel room. He can speak English and lies to her about there not being any rooms available in all the quarantine facilities in all of Paris except for the double bed. He says he will sleep on the floor but later that night she wakes up to the sound of him shaking and coughing because the ground is too cold so she invites him to the warm bed. On day three they start kissing and have sex. She gets pregnant. Eventually the last day of quarantine she talks to English speaking hotel staff who brings lunch and they ask if her and her husband had an nice stay. She says he's not married and then the staff comes back later to tell her the other staff said he specifically said you two were married and there are plenty of free rooms open if it was not specifically requested. Then she pushes him out of the window
