A corporation is building a mega-mall in China. The _first_ of its kind. (ignore the fact that china is already well-developed. it should be a parody on "the core and the periphery" essentialism)

Some enterprising youth are hastiily building a fake historical city on the site that was selected. Can they complete and bury the city in time before ground-breaking starts and their fake city is unearthed?

Spoiler, in the end they sit around watching TV for news hoping that their city was deemed a genuine historical site but they later find out that the corporation is covering everything up and destropying it (they don't know it is fake, they think it is real but they want to cut through any red tape) so now the enterprising youth need to band together to make their city hit the news, fighting any stakeholders that stand in the way.
