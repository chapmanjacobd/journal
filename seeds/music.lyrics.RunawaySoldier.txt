    RunawaySoldier{
    [tune of Milk&Honey]
    My harp plays a song,
    a familiar tune.

    With one eye into the dark, 
    love flys out of the window.

    Stolen silence is lost;
    one millenia old.

    With one hand into the past, 
    love flys out of the window.

    ...

    knowledge running;
    lightly snowing.
    Without balance
    love flys away.
