A Manhattan speakeasy owner felt generous and included in the employee contract that bartenders would be paid an additional bonus of $500 per night when they are busy as long as they mentioned it during contract signing or during termination (or at any point after) as long as they never tell the other employees.

The owner has kept meticulous records over the years and was excited to give the bonus but to his surprise no one ever mentioned it until 30 years later but the young employee recently terminated (the only one terminated for performance issues--only worked for 5 weeks so their bonus is pretty small) wants to start a class-action lawsuit.
