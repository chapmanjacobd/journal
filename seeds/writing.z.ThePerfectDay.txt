> Yesterday my sister died and our son was arrested, yet it was a perfect day.
>
> I saw my sister suffering physically through death, yet not in pain.
>
> Her labored breathing, the rhythmic song, the song changed and her last breath inhaled, exhaled, the body “short-circuit” and her Spirit leaping out with joy to the Heavens, to her real home at last, Free!
>
> The husband consoled by his son, what strength, what grief, he cannot go on, yet he will carry on. Thank God for family, His perfect plan.
>
> Our son’s body imprisoned by addiction, suffering with withdrawals, watched over by his father, the care, the love outpouring. The pain physically and emotionally, the brain repairing.
>
> The father and son in constant deep conversation, interrupted only by sleep. The pains, the hurts revealing, are brought to light, in a split-second of understanding like lightening, to peace and resolution, then the police. The timing!
>
> Old debts must be paid to society. A willing son, now resigned, peacefully submits and knows what he must do.
>
> A perfect day, made perfect through the Spirit of the Lord, the atonement of Christ. He lifts us through our hardships, strengthens us, moves us to high places, like mountains, as upon eagle’s wings, we soar.
>
> Barbara Chapman, 01/28/16
