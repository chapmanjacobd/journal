# AI CEO

Style: claymation
Setting: theatre, minimal set, white background. the audience is never seen but there may be non-diegetic like clay-hand clapping sounds or clay-larynx coughing.

The man in his late 30s sits in front of an uncomfortable desk with a 90s tower and computer monitor. There is a small microwave and water cooler behind his desk. He works at a startup in some capacity. He stops work (something with spreadsheets) because a company meeting is about to start. He gets up and grabs microwavable popcorn and puts it in the microwave.

Instead of powerpoint to catalog and distribute the company vision, the AI CEO makes videos to inspire the human workers. These videos are full hours long cinematic wonders. The majority of this movie/play is watching our human worker watching the AI CEO's video.
