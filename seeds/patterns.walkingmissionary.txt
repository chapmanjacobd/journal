It is kind of funny how churches talk about how their missionaries needed to follow the spirit and spend all day walking to find the perfect person who is receptive to the world of the lord but really it is just because missionaries are bored or embarrassed to talk to people. Walking is good excercise but if they are being honest with themselves they are just wasting time.

A Search for the Truth: Wilford Woodruff  
"This is the first house we felt impressed to stop at after *sixty miles*."

The Challenging and Testifying Missionary by Alvin R. Dyer  
"I remember as a young missionary we left the city of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, to go northward. The sky was blue, it was a beautiful day. It was so still it was almost dull. We had gone about one-half mile on a dirt road when a tremendous whirlwind came up and almost turned us off our feet. I said, "Brother John Clark; we must be going the wrong way." We turned and went the other way and had gone *almost a half day into the country when we turned down a farm lane*."
