What if we drew small landscapes instead of writing our names?

Signing becomes a small art show,
each piece unique

Of course you would still use "initial here" regularly

but it would add a bit more art in life

a signature with animals and trees
flowers and bees

maybe a mosquito
or a bug

a tiny drawing
