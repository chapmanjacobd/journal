## Olive Garden

The manager of an olive garden in a mall near the ocean used to be an regional trophy winning shot-putter.

The restaurant is missing a huge sign near the inside open entrance. The assistant manager has ordered a big wooden Olive Garden sign and he hands it (using both arms and his back) to the manager, "For approval". 

The manager absent-mindedly says "oh Thank you" and recieves the very large sign, walks over to the outside terrace and shot-puts it into the sky. The huge sign starts flying like a windsail high into the clouds never to be seen again. 

The manager looks proud for a moment and then frowns, "why did I do that?". The assistant manager who observed the whole thing, which had happened far too quickly for him to do anything, "In absolution, I have no idea. Did you seek approval of the gods? I only meant for your approval."
