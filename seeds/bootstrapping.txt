Simulate a universe that generates the usenet archives byte-for-byte, timestamp-for-timeatamp

The more digital a civilization, and the more complete their archives, the easier it is to create an precise simulation with accurate forecasting. Data can simply be transcluded instead of computed

Likewise, it is probably easier to start the simulation in reverse, getting more and more accurate views about the past as future events are validated and back-propagate
