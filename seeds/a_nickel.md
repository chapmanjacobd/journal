If you had 400 million dollars and the only rule stipulating its use was that you need to spend it equally across all 8 billion humans, how would you spend it?

The marginal increase in wealth would not even be noticed by the top billion or two. If we asked them to donate their benefit to those less fortunate than themselves, what would happen?

$400 million / 6 billion, now we have $0.067.

    Vaccines are pretty cool. expensive to develop but once the formulae is figured out they are usually pretty inexpensive to mass produce. maybe a few pennies.

$400 million / 2.7 billion; $0.15.

    If we want to spend twice as much, we can only help half as many people. Of course, if we spend the money well then we could have external impacts via increased money velocity but let's ignore those subtle and minor affects for now.

$400 million / 1.3 billion; $0.30.

$400 million / 267 million; $1.50.

    some people can take the day off but one day off is hardly life changing (unless it is a special day for them and they would otherwise not be able to take the day off)

$400 million / 133 million; $3.

$400 million / 67 million; $6.

$400 million / 33 million; $12.

$400 million / 17 million; $24.

    people can start to take a month off from work but they would likely lose their job after that so this might be a net negative (unless they use that month to secure more meaningful labor)

$400 million / 8 million; $48.

$400 million / 4.2 million; $96.

$400 million / 2.1 million; $192.

$400 million / 1 million; $384.

$400 million / 520,833 people; $768.

$400 million / 260,417 people; $1536.

$400 million / 130,208 people; $3072.

$400 million / 65,104 people; $6144.

$400 million / 32,552 people; $12288.

$400 million / 16,276 people; $24576.

$400 million / 8,138 people; $49152.

$400 million / 4,069 people; $98304.

$400 million / 2,035 people; $196608.

$400 million / 1,017 people; $393216.

$400 million / 509 people; $786432.

$400 million / 254 people; $1572864.

$400 million / 127 people; $3145728.

$400 million / 64 people; $6291456.

$400 million / 32 people; $12582912.

$400 million / 16 people; $25165824.

$400 million / 8 people; $50331648.

$400 million / 4 people; $100663296.

$400 million / 2 people; $201326592.

$400 million / 1 person; $400000000.

at this point I would no longer be afraid of US hospital prices and you could convince me to go. I might even take an ambulance, if it was an emergency (instead of collapsing on the street and bleed out of principle).
