I consider myself as an aspiring writer. I know I'm not quite as great as I would like to be though I try to be a great writer. I want to communicate with effective elegance: simplicity. I try to write simply, but I wasn't always this way.
During my sixth grade I schooled at an alternative education charter school in Alpena, Michigan. It was then and there I tried to make my words larger and less peaceable than anything I had ever written. I wanted to be recognized as smart and creative. I was aggressive: revising once with a thesaurus, replacing all pedestrian sixth-grade language with something much more extravagant and impressive.

I quickly found that I did not impress anyone. These words and definitions were shortly forgotten and even I, the writer of them, was left without meaning: without access to my own words. So now I write simply and I try to cherish the words which I do have: the words which everyone has access to, the words everyone understands and takes for granted.

I think true success as a writer comes not from what words you chose to use, but how you use them. Like music, the rhythm and tone is just as important as the melody. This is something that I struggle with, but I'm trying to overcome through practice. I want to grow to become an effective communicator. One of my goals for this semester is to develop an attitude of consistent writing. I want writing to be something that I can take with me through my BYU experience and into my life.

During the last few months of my mission I realized just how valuable my journals were and so I started to compile all of them into an electronic <a href="#TiddlyWiki" class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing">TiddlyWiki</a> which I now take with me on my phone and I update it whenever a new interesting thought or experience happens. I collected it this way so that it would be easy and instant for me to search through the past and reflect on it. It is, in some form, me. Yet even I may forget a thing it will remember. Can this machine be more "me" than I am "me"? If I am just a collection of memories then I'm not sure: it could be.

I don't yet have the audacity to say that I have one specific writing process: each time I write it seems I am in a different state of mind. I'm experiencing life in a different way. Writing for me is a vulnerable thing and I think that is a good thing and writing should be that way. No good art is universal or without weakness. We connect with weaknesses which are closest to our hearts, people similar to us, because we have empathy and I think good writing is the same way. I think the best writing can be found in the books that you absolutely love, but when you try to share them with your friends they just don't connect with it. That book was made for you! You connect with it so it should be your favorite book and you should stick up for it because it is, in some form, you.

I used to be the kid who would stress about writing assignments and I wouldn't do them until the night before they were due, but something changed while I was on my mission: it was probably because I started to write for fun. I don't mind writing now. It's something that can be relaxing and rewarding. I just force myself to start and then I feel really happy while I am doing it, because deep down it's something that I love and that I've always wanted to do.

I've never seriously endeavored to become better at planning out before I write. I can start to plan out, but then I get ideas and I get anxious because I want to start writing in order to capture developed words and ideas.

    i am a writer
    i work through thoughts, feelings, attitudes
    analyzing, editing, discovering self?
    Mindfulness:
    critical for us to understand self,
                   for us to understand character
                   
    revising: reflect now
    revising self.
