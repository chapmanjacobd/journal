> 1998: I had gotten a new scripture quad with my name engraved on it when I got baptized... and you threw it into the toilet along with some pieces of wood (like scraps from 2x4s). Grandma Cain was visiting at the time and although I was distraught she and her no-nonsense attitude immediately got to work blow-drying the pages. Despite her efforts, the gold leaf rubbed off and the pages never lay flat again! good thing the value is what's on the page and not how it lays ;)
> 1999-2000: the young men at church always asked you to say "Chuck Norris" in your toddler voice
> 2002: moved to Page, AZ
>
> December 2012: watching the video of "Angel's Carol" with the French children's choir and suddenly the blue monkey puppet popping out and singing along... :)
>
> December 2013: staying in the hotel room with Colter and trying to get Ber to fall asleep by watching TV (bad idea... he didn't fall asleep until 11PM) perhaps the longest run of Spongebob that Colter had ever watched :)

> 1998, 1999-Father and Son outings...camped in my green Ford Ranger pickup truck, went home after you went to sleep. It was still fun, I thought and I think you did too.
>
> When Grandma Chapman lived with us in Hidden Valley Rd in Wildwood, MO, she would peel you apples all the time...you seemed to like that.
>
> 1998 My mom's sister Sona took our family pictures at Sears, and she commented on how you as a 2 yr old were ruling the house...(typical at that age). You are holding a baseball in some of the pictures...
>
> When you were 2-3 yrs old, I would sing my campfire songs to get you and Carly (and Angela) to sleep, and sometimes tell you stories or read a children's book

> Dad

> 1996 May 11: Jacob Dane Chapman was born in York, Pennsylvania. I was dubbed a “mother’s helper” and worked with mom throughout her pregnancy a little bit so that I could be there when you were born. I was in 8th grad and I think I was at a school dance or something when I got a call that mom was going into labor (we didn’t have cell phones then, so I don’t remember how I found out). I went to the hospital with dad and mom was already there. It was weird seeing mom in pain. I would feed mom ice chips and such. The doctor gave mom an ultrasound to see how you were doing and I was looking at the ultrasound and could tell the umbilical cord was wrapped around your neck…the doctor was looking for other stuff and didn’t notice. I was standing right at mom’s side and you started coming out of the birth canal. You began “crowning” (we could see your head) and the doctor asked if I wanted to see you come out. I felt too uncomfortable and said no. Then boom! You slid right out, all blue because the cord was wrapped around your neck. They put you right on mom’s tummy and she said between tears, “Oh, he’s so beautiful!” Then they started smacking your bum to get you to breathe. You wouldn’t breathe for awhile, then finally you did and you were so mad that they had been slapping your bottom so much. You just cried and cried. I knew then that you would be a force to be reckoned with. ;) Same independent personality then as now! After you were all cleaned and bundled up, dad immediately began singing “Jacob’s Ladder” to you and you quieted right down. We had sung that to you a lot while you were in the womb. ;)
>
> 1996 Summer: I was 14 years old and would take care of you a lot. We moved to St. Louis, and once we were walking into a restaurant and I was holding you. A lady was commenting on how cute you were and she asked, “Is he your baby?” I said no and she said, “Oh I’m so glad!” relieved that I was not a teenage mother. I would put you to sleep a lot and we would always listen to Cat Stevens when I put you to sleep. I would rock and cradle you.
>
> 2000 April: I went to college for the first time—BYU Spring term. I was 17 and you were 4. Holy cow. Had first seizure while I was at BYU and diagnosed with epilepsy.
>
> 2000 August: I went to SVU that fall in Buena Vista, VA.
>
> 2001 August: Chris came home from his mission in Ukraine and 24 hours later we were on the road to SVU together. We were driving an old Toyota that dad had gotten a good deal on. We kept praying we would “make it to Virginia safely.” Right when we crossed the state border, the engine burned up and the car broke down. We got towed the rest of the way to Buena Vista. The Lord answers prayers. Be specific. :)
>
> 2002 June 7: Chris got married.
>
> 2002 Aug: I transferred to BYU and lived in La Jolla condos. One of the most difficult years of my life. I did not like attending BYU very much. To me, it was big, impersonal, and competitive. I felt socially awkward. I missed the small coziness of SVU…the perfect college experience for me.
>
> 2003 Aug-2004 Dec: Lived with the Joneses, a very healing experience. It was so good and comforting to be with family. I lived with them for the last three semesters of school.
>
> 2004 Nov: Our first Thanksgiving in Spring City. Mom and dad had just bought the house and the people turned off the gas. It was freezing cold and the gas company wouldn’t turn on the heat until after the holidays. Haha! So we stayed warm by the fire and space heaters and one-bucket baths.
>
> 2004 Dec: Graduated from BYU
>
> 2004 Dec 28?-July 2005: Left the USA to go teach English in Taiwan. My first time out of the country.
>
> 2005 Aug-2006 June: Went to live with your guys in Littleton, Colorado so that I could attend graduate school at the University of Colorado-Denver. You promptly decided to move from Highlands Ranch, CO to Ephraim, UT once I got there (actually before), so my dream of living close to you all did not materialize. ;) I went to grad classes at UC-D and it didn’t feel right, so after a week of classes, I withdrew. I worked at Copper Mesa Elementary School instead with children with special needs. Loved it.
>
> 2006 Summer: Lived with you guys in Ephraim.
>
> 2006 Sept: I left to start an MA in Victorian Studies at the University of Leicester.
>
> 2007 June: You, Mom, Dad, Carly, and Angie came to visit England. It was pure bliss. Do you remember staying in the Lake District? You gave Ted a quarter and Ted kept it in his kitchen where he could always see it. Years later it was still there. He really liked you and believed in you—saw your potential.
>
> 2008 June: I started working at the Church History Library
>
> 2010 or 2011?: You lived in Sanpete and we were at Church. I was teaching you how to be gentlemanly. If a girl walked into a room and there was no place to sit, I instructed, you were supposed to get up and offer her your chair. You took careful note and shortly thereafter Carly walked into the room and there were no chairs. Being a gentleman, you stood up and offered her your chair. She looked at you quizzically, “What are you doing?” she said. Haha! Just so you know, you still better be offering your seat to the ladies. Guys of class always do that…Carly just obviously wasn’t used to it (but I bet she is now that the guys around her have grown up and she’s not in High School anymore).
