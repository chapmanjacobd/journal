    axioms:
    information is never lost;
    information sticks to the surface of black holes;
    our living consciousness can be recovered, resurrected;

    an advanced civilization becomes very interested in our remains especially information about God and religion because their culture never conceived to listened to God because they were too busy advancing their technology, but now, at the height of their technological empire, they search for higher purpose and an understanding of the meaning of life. 

    this civilization, the Omnak, have sent many probes into black holes in order to collect information and consciousness outside of them. these probes manipulate hawking radiation in order to see meaningful data patterns which were swallowed up by these great monsters. 

    even though the Omnaks can live potentially infinite lives, most choose to be released after around 1000 years in order to make way for the next generation. 

    the Omnaks capture a complete record of Earth at all levels and time periods and begin the long journey home. 

    they measure distances in the number of generations which choose to be released before their destination is reached. 

    space is really big.
