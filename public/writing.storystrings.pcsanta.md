## Politically Correct Santa

    Kids these days are no longer believing.
    They choose to 'grow up' (they think they're advancing), but they're really missing the bigger picture.
    They put too much trust, too much faith in technology.
    They feel pain, but don't let it act as balancing to the pleasure they long to experience and that we all crave.
    Kids these days reject the gifts because they don't accept Santa.
    They refuse to accept the gift because they reject he exists.
    "He isn't real" they say. "And he couldn't help you anyway."

    But the magic is part of the gift that he gives. But so many choose to reject it and they trust their technology to remove their pain.

    Santa is real. He comes over the world to bring his gifts to everyone. The least of which is light and hope. We can cope with the warmth of winter, it will help us to understand the cold of summer.

    But people don't believe in Claus anymore.
    Apathy is growing,
    people are losing faith.
    They look for truths
    on facebook, instagram
    but what they find is only an empty shell of themselves.

## Santa Campaign

    Santa looks at the stats and sees that he is losing favor with the crowd. He launched a new campaign where he teaches everyone good christian values:

    But the people don't want it.

    "Who are you, God?" cries one.
    "We already killed Him." shouts another.
    "We don't need people like you here, disturbing our community. But if you want, while you're here, it only seems fair that we take care of you and all your elves. We'd be doing ourselves a favor, really, we're sure you can see this clearly."

    They proceed to crucify Santa Claus.
