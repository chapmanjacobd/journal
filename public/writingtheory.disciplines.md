Disciplines that I have created for my work:

No restaurant scenes.  
Unless: it's a documentary about restaurants

(though it would also be interesting to make a documentary about restaurants and not have any scenes shot in a restaurant...)

Keep married people together  
Show the world how people work through problems.

## Tension

Increase story tension by showing action and then nothing happening.

Decrease story tension by progressing the story.

## Endings

Whatever feelings felt in Act II should be replaced by opposite or dissimilar feelings in Act III.
