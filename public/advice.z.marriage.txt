A lot of you seem to be interpreting "settled" differently than the way I understand the term. If you settle for someone, you acknowledge that you can do much better in terms of finding a match in terms of communication, shared interests, friendship, sex and so on and that there are major aspects of the person that bothers you a great deal, but you are for some reason overlooking those issues.

The person doesn't have to be perfect at all to be perfect for you. Don't settle for someone who will not be your best friend basically...

Settling doesn't mean not dating a supermodel or prince charming, it means accepting things that you should not accept.


I guess you could say I "settled" for my current partner. He doesn't have job or a license, so I pay the bills and drive him wherever he needs to go. I'm young, bright, and moderately attractive, and plenty of people have said, implicitly or explicitly that I could find someone with a job and a car, and they're absolutely right. On paper I could absolutely do "better."

But what they don't realise is what he does do for me. He cleans the apartment when I'm at work and runs errands for me whenever he can get a ride from a friend. But more importantly, he not only puts up with, but understands and loves my crazy brain.

I've fought depression and anxiety since I was 12, and last year I was diagnosed as possibly a bit bipolar. I've struggled with cutting and eating disorders since I was a young teen. I've had tons of friends and partners who supported me and my mental illnesses, but my boyfriend is the first person I've met who intrinsically understands what I go through. I've spent years trying to downplay and suppress my mental problems in relationships, and for the first time in my life I don't have to. Ive been trying to find someone like this for 13 years. And that's worth way more than money to me.


The grass isn't always greener on the other side...

At first, I thought I was settling since there were a few things that I wished out of our relationship. But then, out of all the good that has come out of the relationship, I realized I was just thinking of the little things that I wished for, and didn't see the big things that she has done for the relationship...

Now, I am happily engaged and ready to marry later this year.


I settled for my wife. Then she proved herself so caring, dedicated, and amazing, I realized, I didn't settle at all... I fucking won the lottery.



She said that the most common pitfall she sees is people falling for "opposites attract." She said, in the beginning, people marry someone different from them because they see it as a positive. In her experience, those unions will last for a while and then eventually the couple can't stand each other because of those same differences. So, she told me some variation is obviously good but the most successful marriages she's seen are the ones where the people were as similar as possible.

Anyway, I've never been married, but that was her take on it after 20 years working in the field.


People are always horrified when I say this, but marriage is a business arrangement in a lot of ways. You're giving someone half your stuff; better make damn sure that you can trust them with it.

Like 90% of life isn't fun. It's about coordinating chores, dealing with finances, caring for children and working. Being so in wuvvvv is awesome, but it won't pay the bills. You've got to be able to communicate effectively, to trust each other and to work together towards a common goal. It's more like the relationship between business partners than the relationship between lovers. I've loved people to pieces and ended up breaking things off because the boring stuff wasn't quite right.

If you can only have fun on dates, don't get married. If you can have fun going grocery shopping or doing laundry, you've got a good shot.


You are wise. This is huge when wanting a life together.

Most of life is the mundane and if a couple does not agree on how money should be spent from early on in the relationship things can get very hostile at home if they try to progress together.

Where to live and what is considered affordable can really differ in a couple which can be a red flag if one is a spender and one is more cautious; attitudes toward debt, and buying cars, and making big purchases together matter a lot. Pay attention to that stuff and how they spend on the small stuff too. Is everything on credit and a fortune owed for what? nothing real to show for it. Those things can be very contentious as time goes by and send the practical spenders over the edge.

Yes, head over heels love is great...but just not with someone who does not share financial concerns jointly and the burden for the debts jointly too.



I've told this story around here before, but the short version is that I had a friend that was dating a girl and the two of them had a lot in common. He really got along well with her, but he didn't have that burning passion that he had always envisioned.

Then one day she asked him why they were together. She said "do I fit or do I feel? In other words, do we make sense together, or do you have a very strong attraction to me?

He thought "this is it... This is where we break up". He said "to be honest with you, it's more of a fit than a feel."

She said "Good. Because the feel wears off. But we will always fit." She confessed to him that some people in the past had dated her just for looks or physical reasons, and if he had this strong passion for her, she was prepared to break it off. Meanwhile he was prepared to break it off because he didn't have that passion. But in that moment, they both found clarity about what was important to them. 



I'm currently dating a girl who hasn't had much attention from men. She doesn't put much effort into her appearance but she has a heart of gold. I love to do things for her because she has genuine gratitude and I think she actually cares about me.

I've been asked if I'm taking the "safe bet" instead of going for the 10/10.

I don't like dating really attractive women... I feel like the whole dynamic is just me trying to win over the 10/10. With the 10/10 putting minimal effort because she will have men chasing her all the time.

My current gf makes me happy and that's all that matters. I'm the lucky one...

The first time I told her she was beautiful she broke down and said "no one has really told me that before."

I couldn't understand why such a great person was never told that... She settled for me and I think I love her... Fuck I miss her right now...



Frequently express your appreciation and affection for the smallest things even. "Thank you for taking out the trash." "I like what you did with the dining room." "You look really nice today." "I love you."

After work give your spouse some time to unwind. Timing is important. Relating the gory details of what junior did in the bathroom or the latest financial crisis can wait until after dinner.

Don't fight in the car! No one likes to feel trapped.

Speaking of the car - your spouse is a grown adult with a driver's license. You don't have to tell them how to drive or point out stop signs, yellow lights or merging traffic. I have a friend who shouts these warnings at her husband and it makes everyone in the car a nervous wreck!

Some things you just need to let go. If after being told three times, the socks are still on the floor, pick them up yourself or resign yourself to sock shaped area rugs without complaint!
