    Interviewer: What gets you up in the morning? (figuratively) What gets you excited to get up?
    Interviewee: I have an alarm clock that makes me solve multiple math problems. (literally) It seems to be pretty effective... even on the easy setting. Addition is enough for me, if I had to do multiplication I would probably stay in bed all day.
