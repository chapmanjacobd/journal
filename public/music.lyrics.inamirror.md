I wrote this song because I like the idea of things having a meaning that is not understood the first time you listen or see something. An example of this might be <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OminousLatinChanting" class="tc-tiddlylink-external">dead language chanting</a>. When writing the English version I focused on the similarities and relationship between us and our savior.

    In a Mirror

    He has suffered for all
    For our salvation, He is our representative
    We praise Him for the freedom He swiftly gives
    As we qualify and meet His commandments,
    He qualifies us to meet God.
    We rely on His grace and He praises us.
    We represent the work of the Father and the Son.
    We must suffer all He gives to us, but He has given us the freedom to choose that better part.

    To work and to love and to serve with our heart,
    He taught us to love God above and to love those around us.
    He set a perfect example of how to love even enemies.

    (translation into a language that I made up for this song...)

    healath oh he onah
    ohna alva na pore
    pradna onah he libe
    Nanare du quant
    a neru
    Kalu du ne
    oh na nare quanta
    kilanda na dios
    noro oh ah gracia
    ag pradath
    du ne onah lalatay
    makanahe alna ah

    (it's really just gibberish that sounds good)
