    There's no such thing as a random number.
    If it's random, it's not a number.
    If it's a number, it's not random.

    You can have a random distribution over numbers,
    but then the randomness is in the distribution,
    not in any particular number that may have been drawn from such a distribution.

    You can't have a number distribution over random,
    that just doesn't make sense...
    or maybe that is the definition of a number system?
