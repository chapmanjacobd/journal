Give audiences something so they start making accusations at the heros in the story. Not to throw them off in a mystery drama, but to show them they are blind. The viewer of media has a god complex. But they really know nothing. They were never there. They never experienced anything! Culture blinds and desensitizes us.

Maybe that was the plot of Kumiko the Treasure Hunter...
