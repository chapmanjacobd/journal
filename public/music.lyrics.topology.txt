lyrics:
baby I think we make a great topology
feeling it
ohhh yeah

baby you're my perfect match
our connection's strong and deep
like a river flowing
never gonna stop

we're intertwined and intertwined
our love is like a braid
never gonna break

baby I think we make a great topology
our love is a network
never gonna stop

we're connected and connected
forever and always
baby I think we make a great topology
ohhh yeah
