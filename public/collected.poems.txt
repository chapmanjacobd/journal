    Life's Mirror
    There are loyal hearts, there are spirits brave,
    There are souls that are pure and true;
    Then give to the world the best that you have,
    And the best will come back to you.

    Give love, and love to your life will flow,
    A strength in your utmost need;
    Have faith, and a score of hearts will show
    Their faith in your work and deed.

    Give truth, and your gift will be paid in kind,
    And honor will honor meet;
    And the smile which is sweet will surely find
    A smile that is just as sweet.

    Give sorrow and pity to those who mourn;
    You will gather in flowers again
    The scattered seeds from your thought outborne
    Though the sowing seemed but vain.

    For life is the mirror of king and slave,
    'Tis just what we are and do;
    Then give to the world the best that you have
    And the best will come back to you.

    Mary Ainge De Vere

    हर घड़ी ख़ुद से उलझना है मुक़द्दर मेरा
    My destiny is to be confused with myself every moment

    मैं ही कश्ती हूँ मुझी में है समुंदर मेरा
    I am the boat, my sea is in me

    किस से पूछूँ कि कहाँ गुम हूँ कई बरसों से
    Whom should I ask where I have been missing for many years

    हर जगह ढूँढता फिरता है मुझे घर मेरा
    I roam everywhere looking for my home

    एक से हो गए मौसमों के चेहरे सारे
    All the faces of the seasons have become one

    मेरी आँखों से कहीं खो गया मंज़र मेरा
    my vision is lost somewhere in my eyes

    मुद्दतें बीत गईं ख़्वाब सुहाना देखे
    Long time passed, see happy dreams

    जागता रहता है हर नींद में बिस्तर मेरा
    my bed keeps awake in every sleep

    आइना देख के निकला था मैं घर से बाहर
    I came out of the house after seeing the mirror

    आज तक हाथ में महफ़ूज़ है पत्थर मेरा
    till date my stone is safe in hand
