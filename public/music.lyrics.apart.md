    and we watched
    the mistakes
    take apart
    the things we made

    we fell together
    but apart
    we see it now
    from aerial views

    thread unweaving
    tales untold
    no one tells
    what's not worth telling

    we both took a part
    reciting lines
    are you still in character?
    I seem to not understand

    want to see me
    again watching
    the same scene
    but you're gone now
    and it's just me
