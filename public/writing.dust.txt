    you want the truth?

             the truth is expensive.
                    it will take everything and leave you hopeless.
              even(you will be alone)by love

                    it will tear you down until you are buried
                           fear, pain, stress
                           an understanding of how small you are
                           how little you matter
                           in a world of infinite worlds
                           in a galaxy of infinite galaxies

              to(you are alone)gether
