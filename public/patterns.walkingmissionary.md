A Search for the Truth: Wilford Woodruff  
"This is the first house we felt impressed to stop at after *sixty miles*."

The Challenging and Testifying Missionary by Alvin R. Dyer  
"I remember as a young missionary we left the city of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, to go northward. The sky was blue, it was a beautiful day. It was so still it was almost dull. We had gone about one-half mile on a dirt road when a tremendous whirlwind came up and almost turned us off our feet. I said, "Brother John Clark; we must be going the wrong way." We turned and went the other way and had gone *almost a half day into the country when we turned down a farm lane*."
