Prose:

Alice lived.

She once was and she now is.
Flakes of snow drifted down from the sky and slowly melted on Alice's cold face.
She was listening to Rob Dougan's new album as she laid down against the old tree near the back of her parent's 20 acre estate.

She stretched out her legs and wondered what it would be like to be like this old tree which came before all which came after it. All which had now dotted the pale white world in which Alice lived. It had seen all the young trees take up root as they reached the heavens.

Alice often came here, alone, to think and impart from this wise old tree.

Poem:

    Now the story was in motion,
    the backdrop had been set,
    the motives if the characters was all that was left,
    the one with the knife was taken away,
    and a somber tune began to play.
    Alice was now to stay.
    Indefinitely.
    Next to the tree.
