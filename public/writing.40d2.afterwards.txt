The Hero's Prison

The runes had once again spoken. He was to return to his family farm and live a happy life. His quest had come to an end.

This would all be good and fine, but he oft missed that gentle breeze of adventure which had grown so familiar to him. He returned to his family farm. He was welcomed to his home town in open arms. There was a celebration to be had for this was the great hero of the world.

He feasted with his kinsfolk for three days, closely escaping the twinge of sadness that he felt when he learned that his family had died in a rubbish heated argument.

Femreldt offered him several of his daughters for marriage for he knew our hero had no spouse as of yet, but this wouldn't do for our hero. No, he wanted to be alone. He needed to be alone. Femreldt let him go.

Our hero returned to his castle mansion determined to now find a new adventure, a new beast to conquer. He would soon start thinking up his own stories, answers to his own thought-up questions. He longed for dashing, passionate battles with dragons which he had only faught a few days previous, but had now felt impossibly far away.

In your darkest moments, you must be your best, your strongest. He longed for those dark moments when he was strongest. He began spending less time working the farm and more time in the dungeons of his castle contemplating as his fields grew over and then finally succumbed to all manner of weeds.

He no longer felt the need to keep servents and maids. His family was gone. He wanted to be alone. To feel the silence. Soon his mansion became a dungeon.

Our hero began to build many models and sculptures of the great demons who had terrorized the land from the north to the south splaying their large fiery arms. Each day he would build and destroy until this false conquest had become a pattern in his life.

Unfortunately, many of the family cattle had become the victims of their irresponsible caretaker's behavior. Though a few had broken free from their chains, driven to a craze from want of food, the loyal cattle held restraint and kept faith that the hero would remember and return to feed them. That is not to say that they waited patiently. They made loud, terse animal noises.

But their savior had other things on his mind. Even if he could hear their cries from deep within those castle walls, their screams might not have even registered in his mind. He felt that something very wrong with the world in which he now lived. He felt that something was missing. Something very important was missing from his world. He had defeated all evil and now evil was missing. Yes, this must be it.

Perhaps here our hero could have realized his fault - that he wasn't living as the runes had instructed. He wasn't living a happy life, but how could he? Could he be happy without evil? He could only dream of slaying evil.

He rose and went to his father's library. He had remembered something. A book. A book his family had carried and passed down. This book his father had locked away out of fear. Perhaps, our hero thought, this book and its immense power can restore the balance which balance I have so foolishly vanquished. The lock fell easily out of his hands, broken.

He flipped through the book: carefully, but desperately scanning each page. He heard footsteps coming from behind him. He turned sharply. A hiss:

"Only those who seek me can find me."

Our hero, shocked from the pompous way this person had entered his castle unannounced. "Who are you?" angrily, he half-shouted.

"I am the prince of this world. I can give you what you seek and long after. I can ease this burden which besets you." said the mysterious visitor.

"If you really are so powerful to call yourself the prince of this world, then tell me of what I desire." declared the hero.

"You seek the balance which you mistakingly overthrew. I can restore this balance to you, but you will be in my debt." the great villain crafted his words carefully.

"You know me well, Prince. I am desperate to return to the war that I was born into." the hero did not recognize the evil of this man, perhaps blinded by desperation he followed unawares.

The prince agreed and smiled. "lndeed, you are desperate, but it will soon be according to your desires. I know you will agree to the terms of my offer. You are indebted to me." the evil fiend turned and vanished.

The hero was excited to see how this was to be accomplished, but he also felt something else inside of him. A sadness or doubt? A darkness deep within himself. A feeling he had not felt before. We're these the dark moments he longed for? The darkness grew until he could feel it come out of his bones slowly rising up until it had reached his skin.

He fell to his knees and began to shake. First only slightly, in his hands, but it continued in aggression until his whole body now began to shake violently. Uncontrollably his head hit the stone floor a multiplicity of times as the pain rose to unbearable levels. He let out a wild scream, something he had never done before, but he was not proud to have accomplished such a feat. More importantly, he didn't recognize it. It didn't sound like him. It didn't even sound human. It sounded like a different creature entirely. Even more importantly his father's books were burning. The family library was on fire! He had to put out the flame. He tried to get up, but he only succeeded in toppling a small table on top of himself, further pinning himself down.

He woke to the sound of his cattle? He tried to get up, but something was on top of him, pushing him down. He opened his eyes. He didn't quite understand the image that was before him so he just sat staring until his brain had finished processing it. The castle was before him, pinning him down and he was sticking out from the great stone walls. "What a peculiar place to be... " he thought. Even more peculiar, he would soon realize, was his size.

He tried moving, but the wall-stones only fell further pinching down his tail. His tail?? He moved about in slow exasperation, pulling in his chest and kicking his legs. He pulled himself out of the castle. He was too weak to analyze what had happened to him. His body ached and his mind was numb with the darkness which had swept over him.

He felt exposed, being outside the castle walls so he made his way to the outer orchard. Exhausted, he gazed upon the castle to see the great destruction which had come upon it. Snarling, he snapped "Surely a great evil has arrived for the castle is nearly ruines."

As he neared the orchard the cattle became silent. They did not recognize him and fear quickly replaced their thoughts of hunger. This silence startled our hero and he knew then that something had changed deep within his walls. He had become a demon of great power, even besting the likes of the great dragon Pheolaryx. He now understood what great blessing his creditor had bestowed upon him. And he felt rage: the great eternal rage of a dragon.

Poem:

    Royal family 
    a hero's tragedy
    modest to think it was mighty; 
    it was insanity. 

    desire to improve, to progress:
    it was vanity.
    when you don't know when to stop 
    you'll be stuck for eternity. 

    Aggression. 
    it only starts, if you want it to stop 
    it'll question your authority. 

    Obsession. 
    next time 
    you might 
    wanna think twice 
    about the things you gonna do
         the things you gonna say
        the moves you gonna make 
       the rules you gonna break. 

    it's tough to lose it, 
    everything 
    in a dream. 

    it's tough you'll lose it, 
    everything 
    in a dream.
