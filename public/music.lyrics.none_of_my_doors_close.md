lyrics:
because none of my doors close
and you're welcome any time

---

Verse 1:
I've got a heart that's open wide
And I'm always here to listen
When you need a shoulder to cry on
Or just someone to talk to

Chorus:
Because none of my doors close
And you're welcome any time
I'll always be here for you
To help you through whatever life brings

Verse 2:
I know that sometimes it's hard
To open up and share your feelings
But I promise that I'll never judge
And I'll always be here to support you

Chorus:
Because none of my doors close
And you're welcome any time
I'll always be here for you
To help you through whatever life brings

Bridge:
So come on over, don't be shy
You don't have to face it alone
I'll be here to hold your hand
And help you find your way

Chorus:
Because none of my doors close
And you're welcome any time
I'll always be here for you
To help you through whatever life brings.
