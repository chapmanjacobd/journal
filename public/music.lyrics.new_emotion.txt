lyrics:
create a new emotion
which constrains postmodern into modern
which brings you back to me power of the past

---

In the midst of chaos and confusion
We need a new emotion
One that can bring us back to the days
Of simplicity and peace

A feeling that constrains the postmodern
And brings us back to the modern
To the times when our hearts were free
And our love was pure and strong

This emotion has the power of the past
It reminds us of the good that we had
And gives us the strength to move forward
With hope and joy in our hearts

Let us embrace this new emotion
And let it guide us to a better tomorrow
Where love and happiness reign
And our hearts are filled with joy once again.

Verse 1:
I'm feeling something different
A new emotion that's emerging
It's pulling me back to the past
Where you and I were meant to last

Chorus:
The power of the past is strong
It's constraining postmodern into modern
And bringing me back to you
Where I know I'm meant to be

Verse 2:
I can't escape the pull
Of our history and what we once knew
The power of the past is too strong
And I'm drawn back to you

Chorus:
The power of the past is strong
It's constraining postmodern into modern
And bringing me back to you
Where I know I'm meant to be

Bridge:
I don't want to fight it
I'm ready to embrace it
The power of the past is here to stay
And I'm ready to be with you again

Chorus:
The power of the past is strong
It's constraining postmodern into modern
And bringing me back to you
Where I know I'm meant to be.

Verse 1:
In this world of confusion
We're lost in a sea of change
But I long for the simplicity
Of a love that remains the same

Chorus:
Create a new emotion
One that brings us back to life
From the chaos of the present
To the power of the past

Verse 2:
Let's break free from the bounds
Of the postmodern world
And find our way back
To the passion and fire
That once burned bright

Chorus:
Create a new emotion
One that constrains the now
And brings us back to the magic
Of a love that lasts forever

Bridge:
In this world of endless choices
We can create our own fate
Let's embrace the past
And let our love reign once again

Chorus:
Create a new emotion
One that reignites our hearts
And brings us back to each other
With the power of the past.

I'm feeling something that I've never felt before
A new emotion that I can't ignore
It's pulling me back to a time of my youth
Back to a place where I found the truth
