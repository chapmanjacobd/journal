# Beliefs that I believe make me unique

Incrementalism is key. When getting a big project batch it up and tackle it in a 10-items-per-day sort of way. I think everyone understands this but few take the time to try to implement it to the extreme. I believe that everything which can be made incremental should be. For example:

- Creating a custom interface for browsing social media so that you can close it for two weeks then you could open it up again picking up right from where you left off. Most people seem satisfied to skip out on the past two weeks and/or they use news to catch up on the latest happenings so that they won't feel awkward when someone asks them for their opinion beside some bubbler at a water fountain convention. But I feel like this is a mistake. There is more serendipity in being late. If you read the old news when everyone else isn't then it is possible you have more context or a different frame of mind and you discover something that few people have. Discontinuity and non-linearity is almost a pre-requisite for divergent thinking.
- I have heard good things about Valve's Steamdeck. The ability to instantly suspend an activity and bring it back up is essential for freeing the human from the computer.

I want to be connected to the computer but I don't want to be sitting down in front of a screen for hours a day. I believe most people share this sentiment--but I think it is very much within our power to make that happen. It is just culture that we choose to use visual feedback to do many things on the computer. I want to explore this area. Here are some ideas:

- Dictation (The technology here is already nearly perfect but I have not integrated it into my life to the extent that it could be. Even now I'm typing and regrettingly keeping my eyes open when I would rather speak or type with my eyes closed [which I'm fully capable of doing. I am only reflecting here that my eyes are open when they definitely don't need to be])
- Text input and audio output
- Motion / activity input and environmental cues output
