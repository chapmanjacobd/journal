If you want an easy credit and free food every Friday, sign up for the Honors English Reading Series. If you just want the food, just show up to the lecture at noon on Friday. If you just want a credit, sign up for Russian choir on Thursdays at 11am. You don't need to know Russian, and you don't even need to go to any concerts.
