Would a radical change in which machines do all labor necessary to sustain all human needs and production be an overall benefit?

    Pro:
    More leisure time
    Increased standard of living 
    Redefinition or elimination of poverty
    basic income is probably necessary 

    Con:
    change in morality; undisciplined populous 
    potential lack of training if all machines stopped... 
    as people-jobs become more specialized... what is their motivation to be working? 
    many people will feel like their life has no purpose
