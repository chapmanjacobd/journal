I created this with the intent of sorting out what are the most important attributes in a potential partner:

1.  How they love me
    -   Do they send love in a love language that I receive?
2.  How they receive love
    -   Well I can't really make this one #8 can I?? :P
    -   It is extremely important that once we have a relationship that my significant other can naturally feel a continuous stream of love from me.
3.  Compatible Personality
4.  Similar Interests
5.  Attractiveness (incl. fashion, the sound of their voice)
6.  Initiative, Social Intelligence
7.  Creativity
8.  Talents
9.  Perspective / Balance
10. Self-control / Disciplines
11. Humor
    -   I realized while making this that this is significantly less important than I initially thought.

It's infinitely more important to me that a person has a love for learning than that they are already "smart". Anyone can choose to love learning, but it's a choice that each individual person has to live.

I need to figure out how I receive love. hmm... Probably quality time or something.
