    sometimes I lay awake at night
    thinking of you

    when the aliens crawl across the roofs and rooms outside 
    across the glass panels 
    and you can almost taste their slimey underbellies
    I think about you

    and I can almost here you in the distant 
    calling my name 
    calling for help
    I wait for you 

    but you're not really there. 
    and I find a way to push myself into sleep
