an improvement on the *Faith is like working out* analogy

Faith is like working out.

But like working out, it's not effective to constantly have strained muscles or to work every single day. It's actually more effective to build most muscle if you give your muscles time to rebuild.

With arm muscles it is most effective when you take a break once a week. you can tell I researched this and the results are very effective... and I'm not suggesting by analogy that we should doubt to build faith, but I am suggesting that sometimes it can build our faith when we look and see miracles without relying on our faith. sometimes He gives us miracles like that. Not always, but I think it works the same way and He knows that. We sometimes need breaks to rebuild our faith into something stronger.
