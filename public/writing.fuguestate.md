    as recorded vertically:

    daybreak
    mid-day
    nightfall

    one looming cloud approaches
    a scapegoat is made
    new moon energy can be used in our favor if we choose to harness that energy to reflect and create a better self?
    LIKE SHADOW:RUNNING

    the emotional cost of an environmental disaster such as these was never quite calculated
    a sudden cause of eviction: none left undisturbed
    all hollow now
    open
    did we ever encompass a planar comprehension

    tDCS, ECT, but midnight now: too late: sleep now
    until comparable, layered cranial bone structures found
    starting to wander
    eclipsed: memories lost&found
    vantages seen

    escape: blue
    escape: red
    we have our own built-in paradise: stay here waiting
    some distant past in-principle
    a mountain pass

    a stage of the mind
    rayleigh waves
    rooms left bitter
    polytomy
    valley of the red sun

    cut
    displace
