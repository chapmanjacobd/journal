The Relationship between the Church and the Gospel:

Both the Gospel of Jesus Christ and the Church of Jesus Christ are divine and true and they have an essential relationship. Understanding that relationship will prevent confusion, misplaced priorities and failed expectations. Such understanding will also result in great personal blessings.

As I attempt to describe and comment upon this essential relationship, it is my prayer that a perspective may be developed among us which enhances our ability to use and share the Gospel of Jesus Christ and the Church of Jesus Christ.

Christ established His Gospel and His Church during His mortal ministry on the Earth. He called and ordained His apostles. They were instructed and trained by Christ. They kept and wrote His gospel and recorded the miracles made through Jesus. They administered the Gospel, the ordinances of the Savior.

The Gospel of Jesus Christ is a divine and perfect plan. It is composed of eternal, unchanging principles, laws, and ordinances. These unchanging principles are universally applicable to every individual regardless of time, place or circumstance.Of such principles, the most important for our personal, individual, salvation are faith, repentance, baptism and receiving the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands after baptism. These principles must be learned and these ordinances must be exact and completed by divine authority.

Those of the priesthood of God have such divine authority. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints is authorized to teach correctly the principles of the Gospel and to administer correctly those ordinances.

The Gospel is the divine plan for salvation and exaltation. We can only truly live the Gospel by learning and understanding its principles. This is why learning and teaching is righteously emphasized in the Church. This is why we have callings and why our faith and strength is tested while we are in the Church: for us to grow in our understanding of the Gospel. The Church gives us many opportunities for gospel growth and gospel service. But even having no calling can be a challenge we have to overcome by ourselves and with God's help.

The Church is the divinely commissioned delivery system that provides the means and distributes the resources to spread the Gospel over all the earth. Programs and policies are developed within the church to help us according to our capacity and circumstances. Under divine direction, these programs and policies may be changed as necessary to help us implement the Gospel in our own lives, and also to help us share the Gospel.

Underlying every aspect of Church programs and policies are gospel principles. As we individually and as we collectively increase our knowledge and application of gospel principles we make our lives more gospel centered.

Sometimes traditions, customs, social practices and personal preferences of individual Church members is misinterpreted as church policy or procedure. However, those listed items are not based on eternal gospel principles and may not be correct for us to follow. It is important therefore to know the difference between the unchanging, eternal, gospel principles and the cultural norms or traditions which may vary with time and circumstance.

Our ability to see the difference between eternal principles and passing norms will enhance as we read the scriptures and critically evaluate what we read. Studying the scriptures this way, we learn the Gospel of Jesus Christ as it is taught by different prophets living in various times, places and circumstances. We can see the blessings people obtained from accepting and applying the eternal principles taught by the prophets. We also can see the varying institutional forms, programs, and policies which were utilized: all divinely designed to spread and implement eternal gospel principles. The practices, policies and procedures of the church may change, but the principles of the Gospel will never change.

The Book of Leviticus is basically a handbook for Hebrew priests and contains many programs, policies and procedures which may seem strange, but if we look close, we can also see the eternal principles of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.

> \[Lev. 19\] In the first two verses we read, “And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel.” (Lev. 19:1–2.) Here is the principle of revelation. God speaks to his children through prophets. He does so today.
>
> Continuing, the Lord said to Moses, “Say unto them, Ye shall be holy: for I the Lord your God am holy.” (Lev. 19:2.) Jesus, in the Sermon on the Mount, said, “Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.” (Matt. 5:48.) Here is an eternal gospel principle.
>
> There follow other eternal principles, some from the Ten Commandments. Also included are rules and programs intended to implement these principles among the ancient Hebrews in their particular circumstances.
>
> For example, the divinely directed responsibility to care for the poor is taught. A program is presented, namely, providing food for the poor by leaving the gleanings of the crops and not reaping the corners of the fields. (See Lev. 19:9–10.) Current programs to care for the poor are much different. The divine law is the same. Yet another principle underlies both programs, ancient and modern: those being assisted are given opportunity to participate in helping themselves to the extent of their capacity.
>
> In verse 13 the principle of honesty is taught, accompanied by a rule requiring employers to pay employees for their work at the end of each day \[Lev. 19:13\]. Generally, today that rule is not necessary. The eternal principle of honesty is implemented by other rules and practices.
>
> Verse 27 contains a rule about personal grooming \[Lev. 19:27\]. It is clearly not applicable to us. However, we also have standards of dress and grooming. Neither is an eternal principle; both are intended to help us implement and share gospel principles.
>
> The principle of forgiveness is also set forth in the same chapter of Leviticus, verse 18, concluding with the second great commandment, “Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself,” with the added divine imprimatur, “I am the Lord.” \[Lev. 19:18\]

Everybody has the opportunity, right and privilege to receive personal witness of church programs, policies and gospel principles. Without such witness, one might feel confused or burdened by what may appear as simply institutional requirements.

We should obey the commandments of God and council of church leaders. Just as blind disobedience is not as bad as knowingly sinning, blind obedience is not quite as good as knowingly obeying. Through study and prayer, we should seek by the influence of the Holy Spirit to develop a personal witness that a gospel principle, or even programs and policies are true and divine.

Fulfilling participation in the Church of Jesus Christ is a result of understanding how Church goals, programs and policies relate to eternal gospel principles. When we see the harmony of the Gospel and the Church we are more likely to attend church programs and follow church policies for the right reasons. Church programs and policies are designed to help us become self-disciplined and live the eternal truths of the Gospel. But to get to that point, we really need to participate and be active and serious. We need each other.

It is not easy to live the Gospel alone. Elder Neal A Maxwell taught "...random, individual goodness is not enough in the fight against evil." Gospel living is a process of continuous individual improvement until preparation is made and qualifications are met in order to enter into the presence of God without guilt and without guile.

> We yearn, as spirit children of our Heavenly Father, for that joy which we once had with Him in the life before this one. His desire is to grant us that sacred wish for unity out of His love for us. He cannot grant it to us as individuals. The joy of unity He wants so much to give us is not solitary. We must seek it and qualify for it with others. It is not surprising then that God urges us to gather so that He can bless us.

Most of my life I have sought understanding by the accumulation of facts and the application of reason. However, that which has most significantly positively affected my life I do not know by facts and reason alone, but with the confirming witness of the Holy Spirit.

May each of us continue to learn and apply the eternal principles of the Gospel, utilizing fully the programs and resources of the Church. The atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ, forgiveness and exaltation is available to all who will accept by faith, repent for, make and keep His sacred covenants. \[Alma 42:22\] Of this I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.
