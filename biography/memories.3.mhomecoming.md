> I realized I did not write about Jake's farewell talk. He gave a parable about kale. Before mom & dad left for Nauvoo four weeks ago, they planted three kale plants in the garden and left another 3 kale plants in the small cartons in which they were purchased. They were close enough to the water source that they got watered when Jake doused it daily, but he didn't notice it there. Upon mom & dad's return, the kale plants in the garden had grown at least 3x the size they had been, while the kale in the cartons had hardly grown at all. The reason for this is because those planted had room to spread their roots into new soil + grow.
> He viewed this time as a missionary as an oppurtunity to learn & grow, and that is what he looks forward to. It was a short but effective talk, well-delivered and well-articulated. It left me with great peace and assurance - Jake will be okay. He will be an outstanding missionary and he will do well. I'm excited for him and will miss him!!!

### Homecoming talk:

Two years ago I gave a talk about the growth I expected to experience on my mission. However, In order to test my expectation of how a mission would help me grow, I had to actually experience a mission for myself.

I quickly found that you can't easily describe a mission or explain the transformative process of a mission. Only those who go on missions truly know what it means to serve a mission. Each person's experience is special.

For this reason alone I encourage all those eligible to serve missions to apply now and serve as soon as possible.

You will grow a lot and you and your family will be blessed in many ways. You will gain a better, more discipliined understanding of yourself. While missionaries may look similar, each missionary is unique and their experience and growth will be different.

We have all been given different talents and weaknesses for a wise purpose. We can help each other through our differences. We all must help each other in order to grow and become stronger.

We are all put into different situations which, when we make correcct choices, will help us become stronger. These "correct choices" do not change over time. Every correct choice that we can make is linked to an eternal principle. Life is not a tedius exam. We are given the answers.

These answers have been given to us in the scriptures. As we carefully study these holy writings we will understand the simple eternal principles which have been organized as "Christ-like attributes". Patience, hope and faith in our trials; virtue and the use of knowledge for good.

The greatest of all the christ-like attributes are the eternal principles of love and charity. In order to grow, we must be constant in our efforts to make correct choices by following these devine traits. We might feel small and weak, unable to follow, but God knows us. He loves us. He sent us here, away from Him, only because He knows we can grow a lot while we are here.

God has promised us that great things are brought to pass by small and simple actions. Compared to God our actions are microscopic, but Heavenly Father is using us to do His great and marvelous work. He sent us here in order that we would be able to learn and grow. Eventually, we will become great.

I have begun to see many similarities between the wise choice we have made to come to Earth and the wise choice we can make by serving missions:

-   We leave our "home" to go to an unfamiliar place in order that we can learn and grow.
-   We are encouraged to leave behind our past life, but continue to use and develop our talents.
-   We will eventually return back to our home (if we keep the commandments and follow the spirit.)
-   We are told that it is never good to be alone. ;)
-   Our primary goal should be to live the gospel and to help others learn and live it.
-   We walk each step by faith and show Him we are willing to follow Him.
-   We hope that our actions will have a lasting affect and will help those who come after us.
-   We are never left completely in the dark. We can use the Holy Spirit to guide us.
-   The faithfulness we had in our previous life affects us here.
-   We all chose to follow the Savior before we left and we all have to choose every day to keep following Him.
-   We need a power beyond our own to accomplish the great work we were sent here to do.
-   We need the help of others and they need our help.

Two years ago I gave a talk about the growth I expected to experience on my mission; but what I didn't talk about, or consider, was the joy I would recieve from the growth of those who would accept the message of the restored gospel.

I saw the people who had a sincere desire to know the truthfulness of our message become transformed as they understood and applied the principles which we taught. They were blessed for their desire and effort and they were able to stop drinking, stop smoking and stop using illegal drugs.

They replaced their bad habits with good, healthy, habits and they no longer feared the unknown. They opened their eyes and began to work miracles in their own families and community.

I encourage everyone here today to lift up your eyes and see the many ways you can help others and lift up our families and community. There are many, if not all of us, who are struggling and lacking every day, but we can build each other up even through simple companionship. I know that as we do these small and simple things, we will be more prepared for the time when His kingdom will be established on Earth as it has already been established in Heaven.

I leave this message with you in the name of Jesus Christ.

Amen.
