I think my earliest memories are of family road trips and watching Abe play SNES games (the snow of zsnes).

I remember once, downstairs, in Denver, Angela and Carly had teamed up and prepared a slideshow presentation to convince mom & dad to give us an allowance. Brittany was against it (she was righteously jealous).

I also remember going to the park and flying big kites.

While I lived in Page I would often be at the house of my friend, Spencer. I have fond memories of feasting upon their snack cupboard and playing lots of games. xP

Lake Powell was a lot of fun, but I remember being scared of the deep water and having a sunburn all the time. One time I made cinnamon pancakes with 1/2 cup of cinnamon instead of the 1/2 teaspoon suggested by the recipe. Unfortunately, they did not taste like pancakes.

In November of 2004 my family bought a Victorian-era home in Spring City, UT. We renovated it together as a family project and started a bed & breakfast business together.

We lived across the street from the old rock church which we would attend (until the ward boundaries changed and we were assigned to the building across town). Around 2006-07 I remember exchanging the VHS tape of the lesson video with a VHS copy of Star Wars that we had in our house. I guess the teacher went outside of the classroom for long enough that I had the time to grab that and pop some popcorn... I will always remember the look on his face when he pressed play and he wasn't expecting a spaceship battle sequence.

I remember living in the laundry room of the b&b. One time I bought Final Fantasy for my DSlite. Dad got upset because it had internet chat capabilities(?) and he thought it was bad. I guess the name sounds bad if you don't know what the game is about.

I remember going over to the freeman's house often. They were good friends and I learned a lot from them. Cave Story, Chrono Trigger, gaia online lol, deviantart. I am grateful for their friendship. I remember selling my old computer to them and then buying it back later. (I think because I wanted to try amahi or play around with linux).

I remember we bought a Nintendo Wii as a family around December 2006. We thought it would be fun to gift it to Dad (he was the only one who wasn't with us at the time of our shopping). He got upset when he opened his gift and turned it into a lesson haha. I think he threatened to return it because it "wasn't a true gift" or something like that, but after explaining the situation to him I think it all worked out. I'm still kind of confused. But playing with Wii homebrew was fun and educational. WiiFlow especially was really cool.

6th grade in Michigan was interesting. We had like 3 different teachers fired and replaced. We lived in a swamp and had a house fan/attic room that was above my room. I didn't fully take advantage of that fact (maybe i was a little bit scared of the giant fan shredding my things), but I did go up there on a few different occasions. We also got our dogs Ceydee and Tripp while we were living there.

My dad was very active in the local scouting program in Alpena (he had to be, we lived in a branch ＼(＾▽＾)／). So I remember doing lots of scouting activities and sleeping a lot outdoors.

I took a sailing course thing over two summers and I don't remember what we did, but it was fun. I think we had one person sailboats.

I researched and bought a flashcart for my DSlite. I got my first real tablet-like device at this time. It was an Archos 5. I would binge-watch BSG and other TV shows. I was living in the future.

I also got an iMac G3 at a garage sale and experimented with Mac OS 9. It was both interesting and boring at the same time.

As I started going to high school, I wanted to join the reading/library club, but I was too intimidated of the coolness of the group.

During Sophmore year, I started doing stuff that I wanted to do and reading and learning about things that interested me. I volunteered at the NS Times. The school's newspaper. I taught myself how to use Acrobat and Indesign and busied myself with collecting and organizing the old editions of the paper. I was able to find every issue so I created and organized my first "real" digital collection. I put together www.nstimes.org. I heard from a friend that a year later it won best-in-state as a high school newspaper website. (I think that is really cool and I'm kind of laughing inside. It was fun though and I learned a lot making it.)

The day I learned I could graduate school with an associates degree was the last day that I would be eligible to apply and my parents were out of town so they couldn't sign the application. HAHA. :/
