Nauvoo

I had a lot of fun coming home to Carly and Jared. I stayed with them for a week. It was a time of transition for everyone. Cooper was leaving and would be staying with Mom & Dad for the remainder of their mission; Carly and Jared had bought a bungalow in Fountain Green and I would help them move out of the Innkeeper's Quarters the two days before my flight to Nauvoo; I had come home from a mission and would be flying out to see my parents who were on their temple mission at Nauvoo. It was a time of transition.

But before leaving for Nauvoo I gave my homecoming talk (though it seemed more like a farewell talk as I would be leaving in a few days...). Chris and his family came down to visit. As did Brittany and her hubby Pete. It was fun to see how much my nieces and nephews had grown and talk with Chris. Carly wanted me to get rid of Tripp so I did. I listed him on KSL and he was given to someone from South Jordan. I also visited Abe that day at the University of Utah hospital. I drove back to Sanpete valley around 2AM.

My parents picked me up from the Peoria airport. At Nauvoo I met my two bearded brother-in-laws and I had fun with them. We had a good visit with Angela and Colter, but everyone left on Sunday after church. Abe decided he wanted to come here and bring his children. He didn't feel like he had somewhere to bring them, but he wanted to spend time with them and that's completely understandable. He should be here tomorrow.

Abe was here for about 17 hours... arrived Friday 8pm. He left right after lunch Saturday so he could visit Angie and Colter in St. Louis. We are putting together a new project that should be very profitable. But I can't do it without him.

I spent like $300 and bought a new wardrobe online from H&M, uniqlo and asos. So we'll see how that turns out. I'm leaving tomorrow to fly back to SLC and I'll be at byu after that... o.o

Dad will give me a priesthood blessing tomorrow morning.

I've arrived at BYU and settled in. This whole experience has already been very positive. I checked in early on Tuesday - right after Carly picked me up from the fasttrack station in Provo - and headed down to Spring City. To my satisfaction I was able to pack everything and wash the clothes I had been wearing in two hours. I then drove up to Provo and parked near budge hall with time to walk to the BYU Broadcasting building and arrive precisely at 3:55pm. The remainder of Tuesday was spent unpacking and ordering pizza with my Taiwanese roommate because our meal plan didn't start until Wednesday. Abe called me and we decided we would meet up soon and have dinner.

Wednesday morning I made myself do 15 push-ups and then went about organizing more things, and learning how my meal plan worked. I started having chest pain around 6pm on Wednesday. Abe picked me up around 7pm. We ate at the Vietnamese place next to Valour and then we went to the new studio in Lehi where he is working/renting out his gear.

I got back to the dorm around 10:30pm and for some reason I texted Katrina. I woke up around 3am and I couldn't get back to sleep because of the intense pain near my heart. (It feels worse when I lay down or bend over.) I eventually decided to go back to sleep around 5 and then I woke up at 7 to get ready for New Student Orientation which would start at 8am. NSO was really fun even if I already knew most of the things they gave presentations on. The things that weren't in the presentations and getting to know the campus made it a valuable time.

Today was similar to yesterday. I should probably go to the health clinic tomorrow to get a checkup on my heart condition and then go shopping while I still have the Scion to zoom around in. I realized just now that I bought the same book at the BYU bookstore that I already bought on Amazon. I will also try to return that tomorrow.

I've started to walk around with my eyes closed. An act of stupidity? of faith? I still open my eyes every few seconds and leave them open while at road crossings. maybe this is just my way to live on the edge, to be a daredevil.

I'm thinking about attending BYU Hawaii... if only for a semester or two. Things are going awesome here though.

I visited Abe yesterday in SLC. He's not doing so well, but we had a good talk. I think he'll snap out of it soon. I'm praying for that.

A girl sat at my table during lunch. She was super nervous, but nice. I thought BYU would be more date-crazy, but I honestly haven't noticed anything. People are still shy here... At least here at Helaman Halls. Most people are freshmen here so that's probably why. I'm pretty lonely tbh... but I'm not going out and dating people for a few reasons: 1. I don't really know how to date. I lived outside of Utah during those 16-18 formative years so I don't really know what that is like. 2, I don't really have anything to gain from doing so. I mean... I really want to find someone to connect with and love, but what is there to really gain from a relationship or marriage? I know it's important, but society is making it harder to see the benefits from doing so. When people are divorced their "love" just steals everything from them and leaves them far worse off than they were before. I can understand why young women are so eager to get married, because it means they will be taken care of. I know I'm being cynical and everything, but on some level this is true and some people live on that level.

My heart aches, but why ache, heart?

I think I was the only freshman to go to Final Cut and the library's screening of the film The Locket. Maybe even the only undergrad. Everyone else was at the football game...

October 28.
I have a lot of music... I've spent probably well over $100 on music this past month. I get a lot of free music from noisetrade.

I spoke with Max and Josh yesterday. I didn't know Josh was at UVU.. Hopefully we will work on a few fun video projects together.

I need to sleep more.

I got accepted to BYU Hawaii! A few weeks ago. But today I will see what I can reasonably graduate with. I'm looking at ICS with Professional Writing, IT, and Education minors; and certificates for Photography and video, and international development. Veronica isn't talking to me. She has hurt feelings or something. I don't know what I did wrong. She is not communicating.

I moved into the Wyview apartments during Spring semester and I liked the much more interesting and stronger community that was there. Carleen reminded me of the importance of keeping a journal. I'm at home now. I just finished classes last week. I'm waiting for the new curriculum at BYUH to be approved and encoded so that I can change my major to Anthropology.
