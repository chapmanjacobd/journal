I wrote in this journal when I was frustrated and needed to write to cope with stress. It is largely pessimistic, but I'm being very open in sharing this so don't tell me that you read it and don't base any major life decisions off of it.

## 2014

8/6
First day at the MTC

A little overwhelming but overall a positive experience. We took family
photos before I was dropped off. Abe got the last hug. Arrived at my classroom, the teacher seems really nice. A good teacher.

We learned some basic words as other people found their way to our classroom. Finally met my companion. He seems like a good guy, similar to me in some ways but different. He's from Wisconsin. He was the first missionary to come from his branch from over 15 years ago.

This mission will be difficult, but it will be worth it.

8/7
"Knocking on a door that's already open."

One elder from my district just had this experience. Maybe that is similar to our situation: "Knock and it shall be opened to you." Ehh... Maybe those are unrelated things.

The air seems different here. I'm unsure of the MTC culture. There are some rules that almost seem contrary to God's laws, but our branch president reminded me of the responsibilities that the MTC staff have to provide a spiritual environment.

I kinda wanna not email my parents tomorrow and see what will happen, but I will probably regret not emailing them when the time to email them has passed. I feel like there are eyes everywhere. Recently, Lucifer has been telling me of the additives in the air. I've been eyeing air ducts extra suspiciously.

STAY VIGILANT

8/8
Today was a good day.

8/9
Today was a long day. Perhaps the first of many to come. We spent most of the day in the classroom. Tomorrow is Sunday. Brother Oldroyd taught us again today. He is an awesome teacher. He knows the language and the gospel well and he has a sincere gaze that makes it difficult to look away from once eye contact is engaged.

8/10
Today is Sunday. Food was kinda lame, but it was okay. We just got a bunch of snacks and candy from elders who will be departing tomorrow.

There were some really good talks today. I cried. I need tape and a stapler. Focus on helping others. A lot of the people around us will be leaving in the next two days.

Elder Mudrow and Sister Pomée laugh when they see my face.

8/11
Still need that stapler and tape.

As missionaries leave, we receive more food gifts from them. We have now become distributers of food...

TALL could really be improved. Especially the UI but I'm imagining the backbend doesn't look so pretty either. It's frustrating to use and feels clunky. Maybe it's different for other languages... But I wish I could help improve it. That seems unlikely however.

Elder Robertson got stressed earlier about the lesson that we prepared for our investigator.

This was unexpected.

I didn't feel very stressed, but we both really need to work on teaching with the spirit. We teach again tomorrow. Hopefully we can do better. The Lord is real and although I don't understand the reason why everything happens the way it does, I know he cares and loves us more than we can possibly imagine in this state.

8/12
Today was a fairly good day.

We taught our investigator, Chris, by the spirit. It went a lot better because we could focus on seeing if he actually understood what we were saying.

8/13
I have a scar on my left kneecap that I never noticed before. I started randomly humming the soundtrack of the pig movie Babe during class. It was very effective in making myself feel happy. I need to remember to start a dream journal.

8/14
Tomorrow is prep day. I got a package from Brittany! A box of six pink frosted cookies. I gave five of them away. The first person was a teacher who was walking down the hall behind us. When I gave her the cookie she was surprised and I think I made her day. That was an awesome feeling. Yay cookies!

We taught Chris again today (we teach him everyday...). We taught him about the word of wisdom and what he needs to do before he is baptised.

Some of my skin is turning yellow.. Maybe it's just dirt. I will go to the health clinic tomorrow. I've gained 13 pounds since I've been here. I can't decide whether to get the JEV or not. I think my whole district got it except for me. But it's not required and kinda expensive. I will have the clinic look at my foot and if I feel impressed to ask about the JEV I will.

8/15
Let these days be numbered by my works.

8/16
By their works ye shall know them.

It's already day 12 which us kind of crazy, but I guess that seems about right. We watched the talk Character of Christ by Elder Bednar today. It was really good. I'm still sick today. We went to the pharmacy yesterday; feels good to get out of the MTC. My companion gave me a blessing. It helped me feel a lot better. He blessed me that I would feel an assurance from the Lord of the reality of my mission and calling. I shed a few tears.

8/17
"Yeah I'm tough."

Just one of the many colloquialisms of Elder Mudrow.

8/19
Today was our first TRC. I feel very close to everyone in my district now. I listened to my music for the first time since arriving here. In TRC we talked to someone who is planning on going into GIS/Emergency mapping. :)

8/20
I feel like I'm not learning anything new and I was disappointed I couldn't listen to music today like... at all.

8/21
We went to the clinic yesterday and I got my ingrown toenail taken care of by a Dr. Jaramillo DPM. He was nice and it has been good so far. The surgery was fairly painless and only took about 20mins.

Today I got a package from my parents. Practicing from the grammar book was fun. I felt like I could easily remember what I learned. Tomorrow is preparation day. I want to do some sealings.

8/22
Hurray! It felt good to email my family. I need to get two notebooks: one for making less important, temporary planning and another for permanent lists, long-term planning and ideas. I love doing sealings at the temple.

8/23
I can't wait for pday again. I don't think this journal is an accurate measurement of what I think about most of the time. I somewhat compartmentalize. I want some tortilla chips. Moses 7:51,52,60? Finished reading through Moses. It would be fun to read the BOM and Bible in chronological order. Today went by pretty fast. I think we-as a district-are finally getting more focused on our studies. My goal as a missionary is to become more converted to Christ and to forget the natural man for a few years. I want to help others through His gospel.

8/24
Today was a very good Sunday.

I feel peace and hope. I just realized I don't have my priesthood line of authority with me. I will see if my parents can send it to me.

8/25
Our district is sharing spiritual experiences. I shared my experience about after doing temple sealings with my parents a temple worker pulled me into another room and told me that I was a god in embryo and that we should never give up on ourselves or feel useless. Elder Staples just told me about his chronological reading harmony of the gospels timeline. :O

8/27
Yesterday I wasn't feeling up to writing in my journal. Today was a good day though. A day of jokes and rivalry. But also good studying and focus. We sang together as a district. I really really liked doing that. Chips and salsa is good.

8/30
Well, time flies when I'm not writing in my journal... On Monday I will assist senior couple missionaries in their arrival to the MTC. Last Wednesday I helped direct incoming missionary traffic. This week I will also be helping incoming missionaries find their classrooms and dorms.

It has been 25 days since my arrival at the MTC. 20 days left. I'm going to miss the friends I've made here. 104 weeks is a long time... I desperately need advanced technologies. Anyway.. This will go by fast if I keep my eyes single to the glory of God. I have faith in that.

8/31
Today was really awesome.

My companion was made district leader. There was an excellent talk given by previous mission president of Alabama, Richard Holzapfel. He emphasized keeping a study journal to record inspiration received and to help us recognize past miracles. He gave a lot of powerful, real-world examples of missionaries who had done so and some of their stories. I cried a few times. I don't often cry. Rejoice is Christ. Go far. Pray for the spirit of discernment.

9/1
:( can't find my key.

Sister Read shared something very awesome today. "God is Justice, Jesus is Mercy and the Holy Ghost is Agency." God respects our ability to make choices and He made a tool to help us with them.

9/2
Found my key. It was in my suitcoat pocket.

The choir director here is really awesome. He tells stories during rehearsal. Stories related to the song we sing. I think his name is Ryan Eggit.

I watched some people switch out a light ballast earlier today. It was very entertaining. Not due to the technicality of such a thing rather their mannerisms and conversation was peculiar. I want to be their friend. They seem pretty cool.

Everything at low levels seems to have agency, probability. The dust obeys God. It's not just lifeless.

9/3
Cebuano districts are leaving tomorrow. Two new districts came in today to take their place. I helped 3 or 4 new missionaries today. I really like doing hosting even though it is a little scary. The Sisters of our district don't seem to like it so much though...

9/4
First Skype TRC today.

We taught Grace. She said her father is best friends with President Aquino, our mission president.

9/7
10 days left.

It was fast Sunday today. I bore a testimony that everyone born on this earth is called to return to Father. But ultimately it is their choice to follow.

I think it would be cool to get a job working on the media crew here. It might be fun...

9/14
Increase your faith through blessing and helping others.

Today marks our 40th day at the MTC. Woah. I just figured out that the pen ink of two different pens I have are interchangeable. I'm now writing to test out the differences... Very interesting. Hard to describe... Hopefully Abe sends his camera in time. We switched cameras because his is smaller, but it still has interchangeable lenses.

9/21
Woke up a little early today so I could write in my journal. Yesterday I just crashed as soon as I was ready for bed. I'm very grateful to be here and see Manila for a few days while our visas are processed. We get to go to the Manila MTC. Very cool opportunity.

I went finding yesterday with Elder Verasco. It was fun. I rode in my first jeepney.

9/22
Tomorrow we get to go to the Manila temple. Hopefully we will also be able to email family. I'm kinda hungry right now, but I can't do anything about it. Also the carrying strap of my bag broke so I need a new one, but I can't really do that either. There's no time in our schedule for bag fixing or bag shopping. I want the person I marry to also experience these trials. Well... Whatever.

9/24
Wow. The people here are just amazing. I love them. All of them. I hope they know that. We arrived in Iloilo and I went proselyting with Elder Mariano. It was a fabulous experience. Unfortunately, he will be going home next transfer so it's probably not going to happen that he will be my trainer. It was a fun day though. We taught the Salazar family in Mandurriao.

Being here is different compared to Manila. Manila is more technologically advanced. Panay is about what I expected the Philippines to be like, except 20x better.

9/25
1st Area: Hamtic, Antique.

Just arrived to my first area. Kind of depressed... but tomorrow and this weekend should be fun! Branch FHE.

I wish I had been able to email my family on Tuesday, but our teacher at the Manila MTC (Sister Garraro) said "let them worry". Silly Garraro; it's not for them - they are living comfortable lives without crazy things happening and everything changing - it's for my mental and social benefit. So I am sane.

9/28
Today was a good day.

Teaching lessons and seeing people learn and grow is what makes a mission so great. We were able to work with members most of the day. It was fun and better than being alone. It also helps the members understand the doctrine better.

10/3
The devil tempts me much to go home. I don't want to not miss home, and I'm not sure if that is really possible, but I don't really want to miss this place any more than I miss Michigan. But... I think it will be ok. I almost had to kill a goat today. My arms are red, but don't hurt... hopefully not a sunburn? I feel like there is something in my throat. Earlier there were hard lumps in my earlobes. They're mostly gone now though. We went on exchanges and shared some scriptures.

10/5
I really just want to go home. I have to sometime so it might as well be now. I don't like living on a sandy foundation, with people who are sensitive and don't understand me. I don't communicate, yes, so I guess I'm the problem. I should change. I'm still adjusting to the food, culture, people and weather.

10/6
I feel a lot better. I should just adjust and call this place home. I'm already adjusted to some of it and I like that part. But it's just so hot sometimes. It feels like a sauna with no end. :/

My companion, Elder Dacutan kept telling me that if I don't adjust I will suffer; so today I adjusted and am no longer participating in the "rice party". HA!

I'm curious for the future. I need to get tuna and recipes so I can make my own food... Good food will help this journey. I also should print out talks that I like. It's hard to do the right thing when you are forced to stay with your companion. I guess it's forcing me to communicate... or not.

I just feel like everything I say offends people.

10/7
I feel like I'm losing more knowledge than I am gaining. I need to think of this place as home and to not be stressed.

10/8
I'm feeling better today, but I would still like to leave early if that is God's will.

10/9
Punted today. 0 lessons. Today was good though.

10/10
It's raining so much and there's a typhoon so we can't proselyte. It is really difficult for me to be anxiously engaged in this cause. Time moves so slow and it is difficult to see any progression. All of my pants are dirty and though I washed them a few days ago, they are still very wet because of the rain.

I think the main problem is that I feel like I'm in bondage. Maybe I won't like the celestial kingdom. I'm unsure. I don't really like this work. The gospel can help many people, but it is a heavy burden to carry at times and in some ways I am damning people as I present the gospel in a way where they might accept it otherwise.

I don't understand a lot of things. I am not good at being patient. Why do missionaries have to be set apart to preach the gospel? Why do people have to be "legally married" before they can be faithful? Faithful without condemnation, I mean.

I hate feeling sick. I feel like there is no hope and because of that, no faith. I feel my talents are being wasted. I wish I had the missionary library. Maybe then I would understand more things. I feel pretty depressed. I don't feel like the area or anybody - even me - is progressing. And I am ashamed because of that.

10/9
I went on exchanges with Elder Gan.

It's been really rainy. I'm finally having more solid poop. I've had diarrhea since arriving in Iloilo. There is a typhoon that will be here tomorrow which might interrupt the planned exchange with the zone leaders in San Jose.

Elder Gan was telling me of his last area in Roxas: haunted apartments, the man at the rice patties, the streetlight which turned off, and the great typhoon. He opened a new area in Roxas. Finding for two months. I spoke too soon about having solid poop.

My bed feels dirty after only one week of sleeping in it. I want to wash them so I'm not so itchy at night, but it is too rainy right now to wash anything: it won't get dry.

My companion told me that I smell and that I need to wash my clothes and my body better. So I will try. It is difficult to wash clothes well. I'm still learning, but it takes a long time even to do it and not have them smell good.

I met Jay Wilmar S. Huelar for the first time today. (I said that like the time lord that I am).

10/11
I feel a little better today. Reading Luke 10:40 I feel like it's my choice to choose to stay or leave the mission early and the Lord will respect my choice and honor the work that I have done for Him up to when I leave. I feel like six months is enough time to fulfill my goals and my purpose here. My head hurts right now, but earlier during conference I felt a calm peace as I decided to leave in March or April. I have already learned so much. I trust the Lord much more now. Almost with all my heart now. I think I will help my brother Abe and study under him as I prepare to attend college or find work. I want to compose hymns. I desire to know more about digital and analog circuits.

10/12
I feel like everything that is in my patriarchal blessing related to serving a mission has already come to pass. :) what a great blessing it is. To be here. To learn and grow. Teach and invite. I still have goals to achieve here though: 1. Learn language 2. Befriend all missionaries 3. Be happy 4. Strengthen priesthood 5. Get fit 6. Spend wisely 7. Gain confidence 8. Learn how to effectively communicate and accelerate friendship making 9. Explore the mountain 10. Read more.

10/14
I was blessed to be able to explore the mountain today. We went to Bengai. The branch wants to open up a group there because it is far from the chapel in hamtic.

I really like <a href="#OneOne" class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing">OneOne</a> Hot Chili flavored rice crackers. Hot rice is also yummy! :) my laundry takes forever. I think I'm getting the hang of it though. I miss home less now, but I still wonder what I am doing with my life. Faith comes and goes. Building higher and higher I suppose.

10/15
I finally had solid poop today. I was kind of worried about that. I honestly didn't think about actually being here for two years when I accepted my call, but I think I need something to happen in the world, with my family or friends before I can make the next move. There is a lot I want to do and learn, but I guess some of that can wait.

I feel like my dad is always running away from something which is why he buries himself in work and we move often. Maybe there is something he missed in learning about staying and dealing with stress and with issues. Maybe I haven't learned that either as I have committed to two years and now feel like going back. I know the Lord matches our choices and he supports righteous action. I want to keep up my journal when I get off my mission. I like writing. I need to be more open and free with how I feel and communicate.

10/15 (night)
Today was a pretty good day. I think I should lay off the milk for a few days. That might be the cause of my constipation. Or maybe it was just the MTC food that I got used to... Anyway. I should start reviewing my goals everyday.

Today was good because I was able to actually feel useful because I was able to speak English and solve an investigator's concern.

10/16
I wonder how the world would be different if Joseph Smith was never martyred. We walked a lot today. Super tired.

10/18
So kapoy. I just need sleep. I don't think I am allowed to sleep right now though which is dumb because I don't feel like I can do anything more. I need to do my laundry, but I just don't have the energy to do that. Also tomorrow is a missionary fasting Sunday and I speak in church. Our mission fasts every 1st, 3rd, and 5th Sunday. I think my talk needs to be like 20minutes long, but I don't have anything written down for that... Part of my reason to serve a mission was to become better at writing and public speaking, social engineering, those are probably the wrong reasons to serve, and I don't think I'm learning how to be better at those things... just worse?

My ears are kinda puffy and my legs feel sprained. I'm probably getting sick again. Super tired. I have to make two duplicates of these progress records right now, I guess. If he wanted a more accurate job he should've hired a xerox copy machine.

10/19
I got upset with my companion because he's forcing me to talk to people. He always makes me sit in the middle when we ride motorcycles. I think he is choosing to not talk to me because of that, but I will be here when he decides to talk again. Maybe it makes him feel more okay when he doesn't talk to the driver if I am sitting in the middle. Like most Filipinos my companion is kinda shy, very sensitive and passive-aggressive, but he is well-meaning and I respect him for that. I want to OYM more, but after I know the language well enough to not make a fool of His church.

10/20
First zone activity and brownout.

Cracker nuts are rather pleasant. Our FHE was canceled (due to the brownout).

10/20 (late night)
Hahaha I think they sent me here because I wanted to be an electrical engineer. Almost every missionary I've met wants to be in EE or a computer specialist.

10/21
Exchange with DAO. Nice apartment. They have an upstairs and a shower. Also lots of utensils and bowls. :D hehe anyway. Today was pretty good. I ate a lot of tuna sandwiches.

10/22 (morning)
The toothbrushes here are really nice. I like the feel of them a lot. They are just a little smaller so they fit in my mouth easier. Life feels more peaceful here in DAO. People listen to 80's music.

Confidence is just knowing you can handle something.

10/22
Today was a pretty good day. Fun climbing mountains. Tiring though. Punted. We only taught one lesson, but it's okay.

Faith is something we will always have to work on. Maybe even in the next life if there is one. I'm still struggling with the language and overcoming my shyness. Maybe I lack a certain chemical in my brain... Or an excess? I can wait this mission out, but would it really help me? I need to be in the right mind and attitude. Do I feel compelled to be here? My trials seem unique, but the answers for spiritual fulfillment are still the same, I guess. I am tired.

I am, at times, jealous of converts to the church because they can see what their life was like before the gospel blessed their life.

10/23
Yesterday, we spent a good 15 minutes on a motorcycle and then 20 minutes getting all sweaty hiking up the mountain. We got to our first appointment and yelled tagbalay (it means owner of the house and it is equivalent to door knocking). The lady looked back at us and then continued watching TV. Elder Nocom motioned me to just wait and sit down. After about 10 minutes she got up and started washing rice. Elder Nocom asked her if we could share a message and she said she was busy. How can I love this sister? I guess it's not a challenge to love nice people, but to love those who do mean things.

The duty I feel to be on a mission does not help me to think clearly or inspire me to work harder... I don't really like being a missionary. At least... Like this. That probably makes me a bad missionary. If not then thinking of ways to get home and thinking of things which I desire not related to missionary work probably does.

I think the main reason why I decided to go on a mission was because I wanted my situation to change. It wasn't because I was in a bad situation, but I desired something new, something better. That wasn't a very good reason. I should've just taken hold of my life and improved it. Now I will have to do that here and again at home.

Maybe the telestial kingdom would be good for me. I like to be alone and not talk to strangers... in a language that I can't speak... I easily feel like people are frustrated or annoyed with me. I need to get past that.

I just want to take a deep sleep and wake up when my mission is over.

10/24
So hungry. I ran out of rice and cereal. Maybe I will make noodles...

Sometimes I feel like I could do this for two years. Sometimes I feel like running away. Sometimes I feel like the mission could end quickly if I got sick or hurt... Sometimes I don't really feel like living or being. It's not that the world would be better without me, I just don't feel useful or like I can do anything well. I either need to be strong and finish my mission or be strong and go home. I hate feeling weak and being weak. Maybe I don't love myself.

I am ok. I can probably do this. I need to rely more on my companion, trust that he can help me, and talk more.

10/26
I really liked today. Even though it wasn't all exactly textbook. But before I recite the events of today, I will record and clarify the past few days. This week has been pretty crazy.

We had two companionship exchanges the past week. The first with DAO which started on Tuesday after district meeting+lunch. It lasted until Thursday morning. Then we had another exchange with the zone leaders on Saturday. I went to San Jose with Elder Lundgreen. It was really good. I learned a lot about being positive and having an eye single to God's glory. Meeting with awesome members or good missionaries has really helped lift me up. Like the Guanco family or Sister Haun who gave me good advice during sacrament meeting in San Jose. The microphone was broken and we couldn't really hear the speaker so we just talked. She helped because I felt she understood my situation and acknowledging that yes, missionary work is difficult but I need to stick with it because it is worth it. Elder Lundgreen and I returned to Hamtic and then both Hamtic A and B got punted from all of our appointments. So we, after helping with a funeral service in Tubog, walked together to Malandog and just talked. It was fun. I feel more a part of the group here. There was an awesome sunset on the beach and we took photos together. It was pretty windy and there is now a steady stream of gentle rain as I write this.

We also visited Sister Maza after taking photos on the beach. Her daughter, Tintin, is preparing to go to Manila for two weeks for OJT and we all shared different scriptures about faith. Then we ate yummy food. Like a four course meal. Haha. It was awesome. Maybe that is the only reason I am in a good mood. Because I ate good food... But it's okay. At least I am in a good mood. :) Elder Lundgreen was generous and gave me the Giant Ilonggo Phrasebook printed out (this was before the mission started distributing these language learning books). So it should be a lot easier to learn the language here...

10/28
Today was a better-than-expected day.

We gave Helen a blessing because she couldn't sleep and felt sick and will be going into surgery. Elder and Sister Sessions brought us cake after district meeting because it is Elder Panganiban's birthday. It is the first cake in the Philippines that I've had that actually tasted like cake. :) also I have a secret love relationship with Cracker Nuts. I need to pack for my first trip back to Iloilo tomorrow. I will organize my desk right now.

11/4
Collecting memories.

I gave Sister Domingo my mightywallet because she really wanted it and it is her birthday. She gave me a pocket sized New Testament military edition which she received from Elder Gan, which I wanted.

11/5
Today was a pretty good day.

I need to overcome my fears and also my worries about responsibility. I think I will leave just a transfer early because it makes sense to me right now and my debit card expires then. I need technology that will help my brain be organized and collected...

Anyway... I want to make a map of my area. I wish I had more time and perspective, understanding and focus. But it is just okay now.

11/6
I feel kinda sick again today. Like there is a rock in my stomach and I'm gonna throw it up. :(

11/8 (8:23am)
I don't really understand why this is so difficult. I'm not even really doing anything and this is tough. Why do I have to go through this? I don't feel mentally okay. I don't know how to gauge myself. I don't know if I need help. I just feel kinda lost. I don't love anyone. I don't love myself. I don't know anything for surety.

Pi Day :)

I am now in my second area: San Miguel. :) The apartment is pretty nice. Small, but modern by Filippino standards. We have 3 stories. The top story is a balcony. We are just 2 missionaries. Me and Elder Frandsen. He is from Texas. He's pretty cool. This apartment actually has a nice shower. :)

There are more wealthy people here with bigger buildings. The chapel in Mandurriao even has carpet. AND CUSHION SEATS!! There are cute girls here also! Yay! :) I am kind of shy to talk to them though. I don't know why. :( I hope I get to stay here for a while. I will probably be here for two transfers. The similarities and differences of this area and my last area are really interesting. Some people speak Karay-a here though so that is good I can kind of understand people. We are only a small group here. About 15 members. We are a 20 minute jeepney ride away from Mandurriao. It's cool here. I really like it. It feels weird though.

I just just got here and the gas tank is already empty. It lasted Elder Frandsen about 3 months. So that cost us 760₱. I might be assigned the group leader since I am district leader, but I think Elder Frandsen should stay as group leader.

We visited the Sorilla family yesterday. They have a big house and a financial business. Brother Sorilla is a councilor of the mission president. We had lunch with them and were talking. One thing he told us was that it is easy to get girlfriends, but it's hard to get a good wife. That's probably true. There are a lot of people in the world, but only a few will listen to God, be a good steward, a good nurturer, and have a good taste in media... ;)

I need to prepare my district lesson. We will also have an activity next Saturday about fellowshipping and inviting nonmember friends to church activities. I also need to do laundry. Also my stomach hurts. :/

Sunday :\]
I am excited to go to Japan... I want to marry a Japanese lady! :) just kidding. well maybe. I don't know. Today was alright. I had weird dreams and we held sacrament meeting in a room right next to our apartment. We had about 5 people attend. 0 investigators. :(

Before that though we had sacrament at the Mandurriao ward. Tonight we will sleep over at the ZL apartment because we are doing Zumba as a zone at 5am. It's weird getting used to the different accent people have here compared to my first area.

3/16 (9:38pm)
Today was fun. We woke up at 5am and did zumba. District meeting is tomorrow. I am super tired. We need to leave extra early tomorrow morning to get the key from the bishop.

We spent a lot of money on travel today. Around 100₱ each. Also I spent like 1100₱ of personal money at SM.

I am falling asleep.

Haha President Aquino interviewed me because I was learning Japanese...

Leon is really nice. I love the air there.

Sister Geraldine came to our apartment at 10pm. She was drunk and took sleeping pills because her husband left; we talked her out of throwing her life away and we told her to go back home because we didn't know what else to do, but we didn't want her to end up dead at our apartment.

Movie idea: future tech: keep two people from meeting each other and falling in love and seperating middle and high class by manipulating the environment.

I was transfered to Tigbauan B. It is in the same stake as San Miguel, but a different zone. Leon is even part of Tigbauan A's area. I miss my last area a lot and my investigators there and Roland Escalera. I was able to see them earlier today because of stake conference.

There are a lot of mosquitoes in this apartment so it kinda sucks. It's right next to church which is awesome, but there is no running water here and the kitchen is in a state of dirtiness. It's not something that could really be cleaned. It's a kitchen area, but it hasn't really earned the full meaning of the word. There are only like 3 plates and 2 spoons so we take turns eating. We could probably buy more spoons and plates, but none of us want to spend the money. I'm just kidding! It's not quite that bad, but it's pretty close. I think there are 4 plates. We pump all our water so we just wash our plates in the same bucket we use to do our laundry. At first I was horrified, but actually it's not that bad. The apartment is honestly a bit small. It would be good for 2 missionaries, but there are 4 of us. Somewhere between cozy and suffocating.

Archi is a recent convert who I met in my last area, but he might move back here to Tigbauan. Sister Quillo who lives in our area adopted him when he was 2 years old, because they can't have children.

I read a magazine earlier today which had statistics stating 5205 Filipinos are born every day and I forget the other numbers I used, but I calculated that probably about 5 babies born are unplanned for every 1 planned baby in the Philippines.

There are many less-active here in Tigbauan. About 260. ~40 come to church every Sunday.

There are a lot of weird, different fruit which grow naturally here in the Philippines. I tried kambis today, it's also called makopa in Tagalog; it's really yummy! A bit like eating a flower bulb... It grows on trees. I didn't see if in my last areas. Also a log of people here do martial arts.

This is a difficult area. We try talking to people, but they just told us to walk on the other side of the street. People usually just go silent and don't show any expression or talk back. One time, I OYM'd this one girl, April May and she wanted to talk to me because I'm white and handsome and stuff, I explained our message to her and gave her a Book of Mormon to read. She showed interest and told us to come back again, but then not 20 minutes later she came and found us to give the Book of Mormon back... :(

My legs hurt. I need to work on a smile that shows my teeth because Filipinos like that a lot more.

Today was a <s>good</s> great day. It started with <s>taking a shower</s> showering with Elder Marines. I'm glad I could see Elder Mariñes again. I know him from my first area. I love his smile and the way he speaks English and everything... I really love him. I think he is calling his girlfriend in Cebu mission right now... :P he is so funny. I love him. He only has 38 days left.

Today was pretty good. I like Sister Quillo. I met her at Archi's real mom's house in San Miguel last Tuesday before I transfered here. She worked with us earlier today.

4/27? (10am)
I played basketball and badminton with the branch president and his wife. They seem like nice people. It was fun.

Eze. 3:17-21

Potential reasons why I was transfered to Tigbauan:
Elder Eñeja / Elder Watkins. They were our ZL in Iloilo Central. They just weren't a good fit for each other. Elder Eñeja started going psycho and tried to find dirt on everybody because he hated life and wanted his situation to change.
Elder Miguel and his legacy. I replaced Elder Miguel when I transferred into San Miguel. He was doing a lot of palagput (bad) things. I think some of those things were late in moving up the command chain / miscommunication so President Aquino thought I basically was Elder Miguel.
Studying Japanese. Okay this is a legitimate reason. I didn't think it was that bad because I felt comfortable enough with speaking Ilonggo and so I started studying Japanese and Tagalog. Mostly Tagalog, but Elder Frandsen probably thought that it was Japanese.
Well... Whatever. I think I'm finally over it.

I've worn the same pants for 5 days... I only have 2 pairs of pants because Brother Roland took one of mine to use as a model to make 2 new pairs of pants. But hopefully they are ready and I get them tomorrow.

We taught the Plan of Salvation to the Fernando family. The father seemed to actually understand it and more surprising he seemed genuinely interested. I've been listening to fairmormon podcasts. They have been pretty interesting and have helped me understand the scriptures better.

My companion is sick. He might have appendicitis. Maybe I have that also because I never usually relax after I eat. :(

5/9
I feel pretty sick. Bad headache, I want to throw up. Maybe I also have a fever... I hate feeling sick. I tried making myself throw up and I feel a little better. My companion is watching the movies that I downloaded before: return with honor, passage to zarahemla and Brigham City; so he is not bored while I'm resting. I started feeling sick 11am yesterday. It wasn't too bad though so we still worked. We also plan to work in a few hours at 6pm. I need to prepare soon: pump water, take a shower... I'm feeling a but better just really weak and nautious. Also there is a heavy pressure on my chest. I don't think I've eaten anything since the slice of bread I had yesterday morning. That is probably why when I tried making myself throw up it didn't really work.

I need to marry someone who will keep trying to do better, set goals and continuously work on developing talents. I don't need to marry a perfectionist. Just someone who is creative and diligent. There's a difference between being determined and obnoxiously overconfident. You can still be humble and be determined. I don't mean to be blind and not see when something won't work. That's the other extreme. But I would prefer that extreme to an extreme of hopelessness and giving up. I need someone who is willing to try things and not be embarrassed or over-think things. Just someone who is self-confident and conscious of the affect they have on their environment. I don't mean being green or economical... But someone who can read the mood. Someone with self-esteem. Someone who doesn't value themselves based on what they think about themselves or what they think others think about themselves. Someone who sees their value as eternal like the way God sees everyone. Value yourself like the way God values you. He sees you in the eternal perspective.

Yay! I feel a lot better! I hate being sick.

Elder Mariñes made me penne speghetti for breakfast because it's my birthday! :) :)

Well it has been about 1 month since I last wrote in my journal. I have already been 19 for 1 month! :O I am old... Kinda.

It's so rainy here. It is raining really hard and

I didn't finish writing in my journal last night because Elder Swanton started talking to me about Masonry. Apparently most of the permanent resident Americans are members. I really like how Elder Swanton explains things. He is funny.

<a href="#YouTube" class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing">YouTube</a> is only 10 years old... :O

~ this is the part where I forget myself and go to work ~

Elder Madrid got really good at driving, several missionary batches departed replaced by several new arrival batches.

I turned 20 yesterday. lol!

I just got out of the mission office and I'm in my last area: Calinog, Iloilo. I'm training my 2nd trainee, Elder Layos. I have three months left to serve and I'm excited for this opportunity to prove myself and get a lot of work done.

6/20
While compiling my life tiddlywiki, I've realized that most of these entries are kind of depressing and that I need to write more when I'm happy. Time went by really fast when I was in the office. It's almost scary. Life can slip away from you.

6/24
Has it really only been four days since my last entry?? I'm trying to make the most of the time I have left. I've also started writing short stories in order to be more prepared for next semester.

Missionary work has been going great! We found a new barangay in our area and everyone there is friendly. A lot has happened in the past four days. I got LBM...

The electricity goes out twice every day for about 45 seconds.

If I ever manage a comedy news network in the Philippines I should rename it Adobong Balita. I just came up with that.

6/25
We did a CSP earlier at Brother Fundador's house. Now they have a CR! I have 36 days left. I almost don't believe that, but at the same time it is still *kind of* far away. I wonder how easily I will adjust back to "normal" society. Elder Staples is going crazy with geometry. He is studying trunkation. I would say he's pretty trunky lol. He's also studying 4D shapes and plotting stuff. I've been thinking and it would probably make sense if quantum entanglement is just parts of 4D shapes protruding into our 3D universe. .. Mmkay maybe I have no idea what I'm talking about.

6/26
And I say unto you, let he that is without sin among you cast the first stone. Then Jesus threw the first, he being among them without sin...

I have really dark humor...

Anyway. Elder Staples and I combined a regular rubics cube with a tetrahedron style rubics cube a few days ago. I took a few photos. We made one that looks like a robot.

Honesty time: I am disillusioned and I am not as smart or cool or talkative as I imagine myself or as I'd like to be, but I'm not terrible and I've definitely improved from my missionary experiences.

I just need to continue to improve and not think about myself too much. Be naturally selfish, but think about others.

I need not worry. Things will work out.

7/5
Alas. My companion is sick today. It's 4pm and we haven't worked yet. Maybe he will feel up to working later though? I wish I had a piano so I could practice... maybe I can build one... out of paper?

7/9
We met our new mission president yesterday. He seems very nice. I think he will be able to help this mission become as good as other missions in the Philippines...

I was reflecting earlier and reading my journal. I remember when Elder Mariñes went home. I'm glad I experienced Tigbauan. I learned a lot there. Especially about people, how they change, but also how they stay the same.

7/10
I saw a weird fish today.

It appears in the rice palay during growing cycle when the palay is covered with water. How does it arrive there? I dunno, but probably through the irrigation system. It grows to about 8in long, 2in diameter and it has a slug-like horizontally-flat face and jaw and large antennae. A person told us that those bitten by the fish develop a fever.

7/13
Ugh. I'm sick again today. Elder Staples stayed with me and we watched the three sequals of Lilo & Stitch.

Tomorrow our departure batch will have our last zone training before we go home. It will be my first and last time at the Leganes chapel. I'm almost home. °o° hopefully this is the last time I get sick until forever.

I wonder how many times I will update my journal before I am back home for seven days and then swept away to Nauvoo for two weeks and then finally at BYU until I figure out the next step of my life.

Am I ready? Yes, I suppose so.
Will this be a difficult transition period? Probably, but it will also be fun.

7/16
I watched a few instructional videos today that were about the psychology of love while I was doing my laundry. They were insightful and fairly interesting. Also I finally figured out how to quickly and effectively wash ties.

I think I've overdosed on biogesic.

7/17
Well... I'm still alive.

Hot oatmeal with ginger energen tastes pretty amazing.

Unfortunately, I have LBM again. But I want to work even though it's raining and I'm sick.

7/18
Elder Staples is also sick. He has a fever.

7/19
I stayed here at the apartment with Elder Staples. He seems to have the same thing I got back in Tigbauan: tonsillitis or something. We plan on going to the hospital tomorrow.

7/26
Whelp. This is my last week. 6 days until my exit interview. Tuesday morning we will fly to Manila. Hopefully the temple will be open so we can go there before we fly to Korea on Wednesday. I'm nervous to go home, but it still seems like a distant thing which is good because it's easy to focus on the work. It's crunch time.

These are my last few days; it really has been a long time. Elder Staples described it to me as leaving home with your DVD player left playing and coming back home you realize you forgot to press pause and you see the end credits of all your friends' single lives. Only now it's your turn to watch the portion of the movie that you didn't see.
