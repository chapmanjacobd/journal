I like solving data problems and combining things in new and interesting ways. The intersection between qualitative and quantitative, between unstructured and structured data, is a place that I like to work in.

I'm fascinated with the text/icon ABC and 123. Maybe I watched Sesame Street too many times as a kid, but it seems really significant. It's simple, but profound. It means we, as a group of unique individuals, are able to communicate over a universally understood medium.

Art is really important to me. Life is boring without it. I strongly believe that the process is as beautiful and more important than the finished product. Technology is a byproduct of applied art and education. Life is really, truly, beautiful and hopefully technology does not ruin it for us.
What makes me happy?

Italian food.

Progression: getting better at things I like.

Making art.

Consuming media, analysis, listening to music.
