Study Journal #1 (déjavu written at the top)

1\. (8/07)

What does the investigator need to experience?  
Completeness of the Gospel, Bear testimony, Prayer, freedom to ask questions

2\. (8/09)

Simple prayer.

3\.

Don't ever give up on investigators.  
The Word of God is The Savior, Modern revelation. Not just the Book of Mormon/Bible.  
Answers to difficult questions don't make people any "safer". Connecting to God makes people "safe".

4\.

Give credit to heaven. Don't take the praise or glory for yourself. Give it all to God.  
If things aren't doing so well, don't give up. Let Him take your stripes. If you're doing all that you can in righteousness, just be patient. You will receive your promised reward.

5\.

The humility "gap". People have different levels of difficulty in this life. We are not to judge.  
Don't judge.  
Only you are your accountability. Think about how you can achieve rather than be jealous. Be content, but think about how you can achieve.  
Willingness to submit to the will of the Father: a change of heart requires your whole heart.  
Enos knew God could not lie.  
Focus on the work and let Him change you.

6\. (8/12)

M looks like W upside down...  
I just now realized this??

7\. (8/17)

My companion gave me a blessing for being sick. It was really powerful and he blessed me to know the reality of my calling and I cried as I felt peace.

8\.

Mosiah 4:9-10, D&C 130:18-22  
Dedicate yourself completely to the Lord's work.

9\.

At the MTC, Missionaries seem really common, but in the field, there will be much more not-missionaries than missionaries; and there will be real miracles.

10\.

Testify, ask questions, share scriptures, and expound.

11\.

Philosophia.

12\.

Feel joy in the journey. Endure to the End. What if Moses didn't obey and part the Red Sea?

13\.

Make sure your companion doesn't slack off. Don't think unkindly of anyone, you don't know their difficulty level. Believe you can accomplish your goals.  
Questions of the Soul: "If it is to be it is up to me."

14\.

Always refocus to what the investigator needs so that they are able to come closer to Christ. (Jacob 5:70, 72)

15\.

(I obviously skipped 15 because it's an unlucky number. y'know... 15. obviously.)

16\. (8/31)

Go Far. Keep a study journal to record your inspiration and revelation. Pray for the Gift of Discernment. Know how your Heavenly Father speaks to you. Rejoice in Christ. Give all praise to the Father. The Lord is working in your mission, preparing those to be ready for **you** to teach the Gospel and He will keep working for **you** after you leave. Richard Holzapfel talk: enabling power and the people of the atonement is grace. (see Isaiah 2:8)

17\. (9/02)

Most effective when working 100% with the Lord. "Whole Heart". There is no conversion in this church without knowledge. Follow up on commitments like reading the Book of Mormon after baptism. Let them talk and listen to them. Take care of new converts. Help them get to the temple.

18\. (9/05)

MTC / 12 Week Program / Remainder of Mission  
Brother Rutherford said his mission felt like 3 parts of equal length.  
(During my training I wrote next to this:  
6 Weeks / 6 Months / 1.5 Years  
Probably because it still felt like a long time even though time was zooming by.)

19\. (9/06)

ALWAYS follow up on commitments.

20\. (9/09)

Joseph W. Sitati Devotional:  
Remember your divine potential and your calling. Gratitude is the mark of a noble soul. Try to figure out *what the atonement means for you personally throughout your entire life*. *Look out for things that will tempt you and take you away from the Spirit. Grateful people are easier to learn from. If you're grateful for these people, don't kill them. If you're thankful for your wife, don't commit adultery.* The restored gospel is the best gift you can give or receive in this life. Honor your covenants. Begin with the End in mind. Remember you are a representative of Jesus Christ. You are entitled to the Lord's help when you are on the Lord's errand. Have faith in yourself and look like it. Be grateful for your life. If you are thankful for something, sincerely, you will remember it. What would God have you do? God loves you. He wants the best for you.  
(I was quoting Sister Read, Sister Pomee and Elder Mudrow in the *italicized* sections.)

21\.

Be an example. Everyone born on this Earth was called to return to the Father. Submissiveness hastens the day. Involve yourself in daily service to others. Actively follow the Spirit. Get better at reflective on the good and correcting the bad.

22\.

Stories told of the firefly trees in Sibunag, Guimaras.

23\.

The great cuddles. The secret is finally known.

24\.

Apologize.

26\.

Focus on your missionary purpose.

27\.

"Would you describe the amount of toilet paper in your stall as desolation or bountiful?"

28\.

"Bless the lives of others with your spiritual gifts." Elder Tatuila?

29\.

Invite the Holy Spirit through prayer of faith. Tell Him your deepest desires.

30\.

Authority comes from Administration; Power comes from righteous obedience. We can become more like God (perfect spirituality) through faith and keeping the commandments. Atonement/Grace is not only for sin, but also to help us in our trials and afflictions.

30.5

Faith:  
Compare Helaman 12+Ether 12  
Alma 7:11-12;44:1-4;58  
Mosiah 4:1-3  
2 Nephi 9:20-23  
Helaman 3:28-29;12:7-13  
D&C 88:7-10,67:41  
D&C 122:7-8

30.75

Departure Devotional 6things:  
1. Love your companions.  
2.Somthing spiritual should go in your journal every day.  
3. It's difficult. Work through it.  
4.The spirit converts, not you.  
5.No regrets.  
6. Increase your testimony of Jesus Christ, Joseph Smith.

31\.

We are spiritual offspring from God.  
Romans 8:16; Acts 17.  
Don't let your fears get in the way.

32\.

Live every day to its fullest. Moroni 7. Don't waste your mission. Up unto the point of death, work. This is the truest church, but we don't hold a monopoly on truth.

33\.

Be bold and loving! If they have fear, help them have faith! Help them understand the importance of baptism.

36\.

Don't let your fears get in the way. Keep track of what you pray for and check up on them. He will answer you in the way best for your growth and development. Most important to prayer is your gratitude. If he doesn't answer a decision question, he wants you to grow and try what you think is best.

37\.

I'm very grateful to be here at the Manilla MTC. Humility is the faith in God to allow Him to shape you. Don't compare yourself with anyone, except your past and future self. Strict obedience is powerful. Missionaries should know for themselves if something is good and brings the spirit or if it doesn't.

38\. (9/26)

Mission Goals:  
Improve people's lives, serve God, Increase faith, learn more about people and become more Christ-like.

39\.

D&C 88:118-126. "Post-graduate" MTC Group. 4th batch ever.  
Alma 26.  
Living next-door to your competition: garden stores all along one street.

40\.

Take it one day at a time. Challenge, but not difficult.. Manilla MTC Trainers: Sister Garraro, Brother Roda.

42\.

(After the first week in my first area) Thinking that this is a dream and I can't go home really helps; I get focused and less concerned. There is nothing to really compare this to.

43\.

Don't compare your current situation with your past. You can't always change where you are, but you can change your attitude. Build confidence talking to people. Be loud. When you see people always smile.

44\.

Always ask questions. Be an example to youth. You influence their desire to serve missions. Invite them to work with you. Find leaders to bring the church out of obscurity.

45\.

Just be excited to share the gospel and improve peoples' lives. Always have the spirit. Everything will be ok. Trust in the Lord.

46\.

Always be worthy to act in His name and have the confidence to do so.

47\.

Ants spontaneously appear.

48\.

It's better to love every person we teach than teach every person we love. (I think Elder Nocom shared this during our district meeting.) Patience, faith.

49\.

To learn a language fast, talk to the kids. The children. They will help you and won't make fun of you. Usually. Also memorize phrases rather than vocab.

50\.

Just talk to people. Learn how to communicate or manipulate or offend them. It's all good. Rejection therapy, social engineering, NLP, whatever. Just talk to people!!

51\.

Reality is the best learning environment. Sometimes the best tool is the imperfect tool.

52\. (10/11)

Gen.Conf:  
See yourself as you really are. Where is your treasure? Find happiness and act without guile. Have purpose. Set a goal and go. Consider the consequences. Serve God before man.

53\.

Adjust life when necessary to fulfill the blessings declared in your patriarchal blessing. We need a constant stream of revelation though we should remember the Lord's answer If you forgot or are confused, ask again. He understands.

54\.

Hope is something you want to happen. Faith is something you believe in and believe will happen so you act on you belief. Good food really makes me happy. Enjoy life now rather than later. Plan for the future, but live in the present. Not following your dreams is committing spiritual suicide. Either change your life in that instant or change your goals temporarily. I feel like I am not accomplishing what I want to do with my life, but I need to put God first and serve Him. He wants me to be happy, but He also desires that I serve His children and give them the Gospel that I have been blessed with. **He wants me to be anxiously engaged in a good cause and this is the best cause: the welfare and salvation of the souls of men.**  
I resolve to be more engaged and live in this moment. I feel I would enjoy being a ward missionary more than this... This is fun, but not spiritually fulfilling. I need to focus on learning the language so I can communicate effectively.

55\.

Embrace failure and rejection. Everyone lives with it. Just deal with it. Try making rejection your goal for a few days. Ask unusual requests of people. Live with a balance. Don't be afraid to fail, but try to succeed.

56\.

Being sensitive does not necessarily mean being perceptive. Maybe patience only applies to things you can't change. Be bold. Make a name for yourself. You will never live in this exact moment ever again. Time is most precious.

57\.

Remove accusation from language.

58\.

Don't push yourself away from things you love. Embrace them. Just include yourself in the activities which you know you want to be in, but never felt like you could. Be friendly! Talk to those you admire.

59\.

Saying you are new and need help with the language will open up a lot of people.

60\.

Try singing hymns to people. It is not enough to just know or study the gospel. We have to apply the gospel into your lives and live it. Develop faith in Christ and only then, through Him, we can develop Christ-like attributes. He doesn't ask us to be perfect from the start. He just wants us to repent and progress.

61\.

Natural selection is not perfect selection. Our bodies may need to rely on faith and beliefs because it is truly divine for us to be this way or a manifestation of the weakness of natural selection.

62\.

Don't give out "free" Book of Mormon. Say they can borrow it and get their name and address to pick it up later...

63\.

Read–Becoming Perfected in Christ from the Liahona, July 2014  
Less actives can't rely on us for spiritual renewal. They need to come to church and show their support for the gospel by being there and being active.

Eath divided at the time of the great flood. Baptism is by immersion of water and fire. Earth covered in water during Noah's time and will later be covered by fire (not real fire) during the millennium.

66\. (12/13)

Look for and appreciate the good in your companions. Just forget the negative. Try to adapt the good into your life.

67\. (11/20)

If you just keep pushing yourself into someone's life they will start to love you. At least if you are making connections and you aren't serial killer or whatever..

69\.

Joseph F. Smith: The auxiliary organizations of the church would not be needed if the priesthood fully magnified their callings.

70\.

Set Goals  
Allow for compromise  
Gather Family Feedback  
Establish Priorities...

Even in my own little town, there are streets I've never been on.

"No-intro" youtube music channel idea: create videos that go straight to the 1st verse or chorus of a song.

79\.

Jeepney video game/VR sim: be a driver, conductor or passenger.

80\.

The value is whats on the page, not how the page lays.

Put your trust in fear or hope. (this is basically #81. I guess this was on my mind for a while)

86\.

If everyone had perfect faith, there would be no need for missionary work.

4/12

(Enter San Miguel)  
Start with faith. If you start the Lord will help you.  
Four posts eventually becomes a house. Think "how is this - what I am doing - helping me become a better person/father?" then do less crap.  
We obey God's commandments because we love Him.

5/15

(Tigbauan)  
fast thinking vs slow thinking and our happiness...

5/16

Pornographic culture desensitizes us as a society to accept pornography. This can be many things. How can we better understand our adversity to overcome him?

5/30

Teleportation is a much better superpower than super-speed.

6/1

Media is useless if it just entertains us. It needs to educate us.  
History is amazing if you think about the real people.

6/2

We use the computer to find information we are missing, but in the future the computer will tell us what information is missing. DIBA??!!

6/6

Would God's kingdom be anything less than the greatest possible thing we can imagine? I think no.  
Why develop habits or hobbies, passions or lifestyles which can't be satisfied in the next life?  
Abraham was sacrificed to Egyptian gods by his father then, later in his life, Abraham was asked to sacrifice his son to His Father.

6/9

I wonder if, in the future, will people be required to choose either the Lord, Jesus Christ or our technology as our savior.

6/12

"Cup of milk, sandwich, volume, brightness, stick sensitivity. It's all I need." Elder Swanton

6/14

Air conditioning gives me a headache.

Information is very cheap, but it wants to be expensive.

7/10

Information wants to be expensive, but it needs to be free. Information that can save or improve people's lives should not be locked up or monetized.

Use & Abuse of blessings by B. Young 1853

7/19

Instead of leaving a journal for my children, I'd rather leave projects and theses. Journals are useful for personal reflection, however...

7/19A

Patents are available to encourage the public release of specification to new research and designs that might otherwise be protected by trade secrets.

7/20

"...regardless of your present age, you are building your life; it will be cheap and shoddy or it will be valuable and beautiful; it will be full of constructive activities or it can be destructive; it can be full of joy and happiness, or it can be full of misery. It all depends upon you and your attitudes, for your altitude, or the height you climb, is dependent upon your attitude or your response to situations." Spencer W Kimball

7/20A

Faith is changing the way you perceive through hope and action. You can do anything if you believe and try and obey.

7/20B

Fish-tank-swing: *The patent is the art*TM  
it's a swingset that has fish tanks instead of seats.

If you want something, there are lots of ways to get it. If you don't want to do something, there are lots of excuses to not do things.

9/2

The more important something becomes to a society, it matters less how one gets it.

9/2A

I feel a little trapped. I haven't really felt this, paranoia, before; but when I entered the MTC it started.

Around this time in my mission, I entered the mission office. I had a lot of fun and learned a lot of things while I was there and I felt at peace.

Thoughts Journal

~5/13

I rely on my environment. Place is as important to me as time. Conflict and change push me further and further inside my own head. I am critical of myself to the point that it cripples me.  
  
I don't know what it is: the heat, feeling sick, missing the office elders, or not being able to use the computer... but this place... the place is fine, the apartment is nice, I only have 3mo. left, but I feel like hell. I feel terrible. Maybe it is just the sickness that is making me feel... and the stress. I don't know why I am stressed.  
But I am stressed. Elder Staples is good at keeping rules, but I felt healthy, I felt good being in the office. I guess I am still adjusting.  
I think like a borderline when I am stressed. I feel like everyone is against me. I just need to relax.. but I wouldn't feel good about myself if I listened to soothing music during non-music hours.

5/22

I feel a lot better now. It just takes a week or so to get adjusted.
