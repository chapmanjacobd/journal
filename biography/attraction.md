I noticed a pattern of some of the unique qualities of the people that I like:

-   they use the word "giddy" even though they aren't from Australia or New Zealand. Not saying Australian girls are bad.
-   for some reason they really like <a href="#%24%3A%2FTheLittlePrince" class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves">The LIttle Prince</a>.
-   they believe "everything happens for a reason".
-   they are usually ENTP, ENFJ, or ENFP. I guess that means I am INTJ. Or maybe I am INFP. <a href="#thoughts.personalitytest" class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves">I'm not sure</a>.
-   I like people that talk a lot, because I like listening to people.

UPDATE: I am probably INTP because I overthink things *waaaaayyy* too much. But it's a good thing.
