After 3 years as a Senior Engineer at Atlas AI, where I specialized in spatial data infrastructure and pipelines, I'm looking for new opportunities to continue growing.

At Atlas AI, I worked on a variety of vector and raster data ingest and transformation workflows. I also created numerous ad-hoc scripts for data processing and customer deliverables.

My core skills include:

- Data engineering with spatial & non-spatial data (GeoPandas, PostGIS, GDAL/OGR)
- General software engineering (Python, PostgreSQL, Linux, writing CLI tools, AWS Batch / Google Cloud Batch)
- Analytics engineering (DBT, BigQuery, SQLite)

I'm interested in joining a team where I can apply my experience and make a positive impact in the world. If you know of any roles involving data please reach out! I'm eager to take on new challenges and continue advancing my expertise.
