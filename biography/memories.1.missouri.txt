In 2012 my dad got a job working at the hospital in Columbia, MO. We packed up our things and moved.

Shortly after that, we moved to the other side of town.

During the winter I felt strongly that I should graduate high school early so that I could go to college sooner. I regretted not looking ahead and learning about being able to graduate high school with an associates degree so I wanted to catch up and live life to the fullest.

As part of graduating early I took an online History of Photography class and a Classical Roots (greek & latin etymology) class. These were some of my favorite classes. In order to graduate early I dropped a Laser Tech class I was going to take (I think it took up too many of my HS class hours or something). I think my life would be a lot different if I took that class. But you never know. CO2 lasers are pretty crazy tho.

In October it was announced that male LDS Missionaries could start at age 18. I thought this would be a good opportunity to improve myself and sharpen my hidden talents. I was glad that I would be able to go to college for a year before leaving on a mission.

My last semester of HS I completed about double normal course-load. I was able to do it by taking siestas and self-experimentation of alternative sleep cycles. Life was strange, but it was great.
