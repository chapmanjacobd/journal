On the road with Cooper, Mom, and Dad traveling back home from our three week long road trip. We left Pennsylvania Monday morning and are now in Colorado. Dad has a habit of making us leave early in the morning. I just put the last finishing touches on my programmable keyboard main layer. I think I will upload it to github once I get it to compile. This is my first C project and it is quite fun.

Things have been going pretty well. In the car again traveling with my parents. We are in Logan going to a Pageant that Chris' family is a part in. Early this morning I popped a ligament in my neck so I am in some pain. I also worked with Spencer to get the old NS Times website working for Ben Cox. <a href="#VirtualBox" class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing">VirtualBox</a> is actually pretty powerful though there is a small amount of wasteful overhead. I also watched Hero and the third segment of Do You Speak American? while in the car.

Wool socks are amazing.

I've got to be honest. Life is pretty good! :) I like it a lot more here than provo. I have a good job here, taking really great classes and I feel a part of the community. There are still times that I feel lonely, but much less than anytime before in my life really. It's really good here! I feel like I'm part of something.
